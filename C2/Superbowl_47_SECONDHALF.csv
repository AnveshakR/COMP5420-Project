"I know I'm rarely popular, but I want to say it aloud for my own sanity:

By the book, that's a penalty. But by the way they refs called the game and what they've allowed, they aren't going to randomly start calling it now. As a coach and a team you have to know you're getting squeezed in the strike zone by the umpire, so you have to be careful with your pitch selection.

If there's no PI called, you can't throw fades. Rip that page right out of your playbook. Do you feel burned, 49er fans? You should. It sucks. But you have to accept the fact that when there's PI like this, it must be quick slants/outs because your guy isn't gonna get to complete his route.",1359949294.0,15,:Steelers: Steelers

Davis was definitely held on that last goal line drive by the 49ers, but that's not why the 49ers lost the game and any 49ers fan who says so is wrong. The 49ers had the chance to put it away there at the end and screwed it up. They shouldn't have even been in that position but their own mistakes fucked them over.
