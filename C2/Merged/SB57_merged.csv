Overall people are really out there to have fun, no matter what team you root for.

See, if there's a high-profile ~~football~~ *soccer* match over here in the Netherlands (say... Ajax vs. Feyenoord) then you should expect trouble. Fans are kept separated by police, fans don't get to enter the arena at the same locations and basically the whole area is on edge.

Seems *completely* different over there. That NFL live show with fans from both teams just standing around and having fun?  I'd deem that completely impossible over here.

"All folks are going to talk about is that penalty, which is a shame.  This was a fantastic game start to finish.  The Eagles could have truly put this to bed with just ONE defensive stop in the second half - which they could not manage.  When the pressure was the greatest the Chiefs stepped up on both sides of the ball, and the Eagles did not.  

At the half it felt like the Eagles were going to break this wide open - they felt dominant, especially when Hurts ran the ball.  He was truly awesome on the ground, and made quite a few big time throws for crucial conversions, but as the game went on it felt like Philly tightened from the top down.  The playcalling got too cute, too much reliance on Hurts' arm, which ain't bad but its not his strength, not when you have to chew clock.  

Its a testament to the Chiefs' resilience, their experience, that brought them this Super Bowl win.  Don't tell me halftime adjustments don't exist, especially when the halftime is twice as long, because the Chiefs came out looking Chiefsy, and the Eagles couldn't match it.",1676258635.0,5,:Panthers: Panthers,Football,3

"The amount of potential that flag cost this game is unbelievable 

If the Chiefs make the FG and the Eagles get the ball back with ~1:40 on the clock, the game could end like:

‚Äî Eagles are stopped/miss FG/turn the ball over and the Chiefs win

‚Äî Eagles get a late FG to force OT

‚Äî Eagles get a fast FG and KC still has time to try and win/tie on their next possession 

‚Äî Eagles get a fast TD and now the Chiefs are on their heels, needing a TD within 45-75 seconds to win (score would be 42-38)

‚Äî Eagles get a late/walkoff TD and win with little time for the Chiefs to properly attempt a drive

Instead we got an extremely weak flag, kneel downs to kill clock, and a horrible hail mary throw attempt.

I‚Äôd have taken any of those other possible outcomes over whatever the fuck it is we got instead",1676260743.0,9,:Patriots: Patriots,Football,3

We saw how defensive backs adjusted their game with the PI rule changes all those years ago. They went from getting called for PI all the time to being the best the NFL has ever seen.

They need to *only* call the most egregious of penalties. No debate penalties. ‚ÄúThat guy got borderline dragged to the turf being held‚Äù type of penalties. ‚ÄúThat guy was nearly decapitated‚Äù penalties.

These ‚Äúwe let them play until we didn‚Äôt‚Äù penalties absolutely *kill* these games. That was a brutal ending to a great fucking Super Bowl because they suddenly decided they were going to call a different type of game. That is *fucked up*. We are going to be able to go back and rewatch this game and find that same penalty occur and not get called until it was. They need to entirely reevaluate their reffing philosophies. It *cannot* continue to be the middling ‚Äúsometimes we call it and sometimes we don‚Äôt‚Äù approach to reffing.

Sometimes I notice they all run super fast to start the next play and other times they go slow? Sometimes the clock runs after a play, sometimes not?


So they get near the end zone, DONT score, and do a 3-point field goal instead, giving the other team less time to score (since after they score the ball goes back to the other team)? That‚Äôs it? Are you allowed to go for a 3-point field goal whenever you want?

"I‚Äôm a diehard Pats fan. I‚Äôve watched highlights from our Super Bowls more times than I care to admit. One play that I‚Äôll always remember is Julian Edelman scoring the go-ahead TD against the Seahawks in 2014 late in the 4th. 

The reason I bring it up is because he very easily could have been called for an offensive PI after he shoved off his defender to get space on that play. Only the refs didn‚Äôt call it because it was the last moments of an epic super bowl, and that‚Äôs a 50/50 call any given Sunday so thankfully that ref crew opted to let them play. I would have been salty if it happened to my team, but I would have eventually gotten over it.

I don‚Äôt think it was necessarily egregious or anything. In real time, if a ref sees a hand on the WR‚Äôs hip on an overthrow and a little bit of a jersey pull that looks like a hold. Even still, Philly benefited from a few calls that could have gone either way - namely, the Sanders incompletion as well as a couple of uncalled holding penalties on Chris Jones.

"The Eagles defense utterly sucked but Hurts being robbed of a chance to go down and win the game because of a soft ass holding call will hang over this one. Was an all time great Super Bowl and to have the refs interfere like that- like maybe the Chiefs still win! I didnt really care who won, was rooting for KC if anything, but man I feel bad for Hurts not even getting a chance. Should have been 38-35 KC with like 1:40 and 1 timeout for Hurts to have his shot. 

And conspiracy wise it doesnt make sense either- NFL would rather rather have Hurts have a shot to go down and score and add more drama to the end. This was just incompetent reffing. There is no way you call that hold in that situation, it would have been a ticky tack holding call regardless of the situation but just to hand the Chiefs the game like that just makes it more godawful. Only people who liked that ending are Chiefs fans and NFCE fans that aren't Eagles and maybe not all of them.

Never ever feels good to have a SB end like that, just kinda sucked all the excitement out of what was a crazy good game.",1676258388.0,23,:Panthers: Panthers :Bengals: Bengals,Football,2
