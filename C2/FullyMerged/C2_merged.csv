2. Predict the total verbal or image references during the game for an all new episode of ELEMENTARY, coming up on CBS right after the game. This includes commercials. **The over/under is 6 and ½.**

3. Predict the total verbal or image references during the game for the CBS Monday night comedy lineup (any reference to HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, 2 BROKE GIRLS, MIKE AND MOLLY, RULES OF ENGAGEMENT) Same rules as above. A commercial referencing more than 1 of the shows still counts as just 1. **The over/under is 7 and 1/2.**

4. Predict the total number of camera shots of Proud Papa Jack Harbaugh, in his seat or box during the game.  **The over/under is 3 and ½.**

5. Predict the total number of pictures or videos showing young Jim and John Harbaugh.  **The over/under is 1 and 1/2.**

6. Any mention of the word “Pistol,” or reference to the “Pistol formation,” by Phil Simms, Jim Nantz, Steve Tasker, or Solomon Wilcots.  **The over/under is 6 and ½.**

7.  Predict how many times annoying rube Phil Simms will admit he was wrong about something.  This includes past documented instances like “my bad,” “I don’t know what I was thinking,” “check that,” and “forget it,” or other new and thrilling examples.   **The over/under is 1 and 1/2.**

8. . Still images or video of Ray Lewis as a younger Baltimore Raven.  This could be a shot of him in Super Bowl, XXXV, or perhaps his first career sack, of Colts QB Jim Harbaugh.    **he over/under is 1 and 1/2.**

9.  Total number of verbal or image references to either former 49’er QBs Joe Montana or Steve Young.  “Young Colin Kaepernick is in some good company…”  **The over/under is 1 and ½.**

10. Name 3 former super bowl winning coaches who will be mentioned by name.

1) The Ravens screwed up my Super Pick Em horribly throughout the playoffs. Ugh!

2) Though I don't think it changed the outcome of the game, I think the refs should have tried harder to pretend to be unbiased. That last holding call is the one people will talk about, but there were 2 no calls on pass interference early that gave the Ravens another shot when they shouldn't have had it.

3) I still don't think Flacco is an elite quarterback. I place him in the same tier as Eli Manning.

4) The 49ers have a lot to look forward to in the next few years. I'm not sure CK can keep taking hits like he did, but they should be good for a while.

5) Can safeties really just not defend deep passes from Flacco? Some of these in the postseason have been just _horrible_.

MOST IMPORTANTLY) Congrats to the Ravens (sans Ray Lewis, but that's a personal bias)! The played to win, and that's exactly what they did.

"I think football is as fun and exciting as the next guy, but this super bowl really showed how bullshit it can be. So many calls in this sport can go either way and they all have such a huge impact on the game. Pass interference, holding, these types of calls can drastically change the outcome of the game, even if it isn't a big yardage play. And in many close scenarios it is a fucking toss up as to whether it will be called or not.

 In other sports refereeing is important, but getting a ball or strike wrong in baseball usually does not have close to the size of impact a blown football call would have, you can even argue making slight adjustments to an umpires strike zone is a big part of the game. In sports like hockey, basketball, soccer making the right calls is still very important, but again most rarely have the impact a call or no call would have in a football game. On top of this football calls seem to be so much more subjective. 

Half the time a game is decently close, it seems all people talk about is the bad calls or no calls. Sometimes this sport leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth.",1359953219.0,8.0,,Football,3,2N

"Just a few thoughts on the holding ""no-call""

1) Sure, it was holding...but there were plenty of calls that weren't made. It was a loosely called game but that's not exactly a bad thing because it was relatively consistent.

2) They let the game end on the players terms which, in my opinion, makes the ending of the game more desirable than if a flag was thrown. I didn't want to spend the next 15 years watching highlights of that Super Bowl with a slow-mo clip of flags being thrown.

3) You can shit on the refs for that call all you want, but the 9ers offensive put itself in that position with poor playcalling, notably Kaepernick not being able to read/adjust to the Ravens BLATANT show of the house blitz.

Having to call a time out in the third quarter. Kaepernick throwing a pick. He had a few other bad passes too. Overall, both sides ended up playing great, and the game was exciting, but there were so many other plays that the 49ers didn't capitalize on/got beat on that turned the tide of the game more than any officiating mistake.

The entire fucking secondary needs to be shipped out and players brought in who don't depend on not getting called for interference and big hits.  Kaepernick may have the big arm bit hopefully at some point his brain moves from his biceps to his head.  Two wasted timeouts because this team can't figure out how to get the damn plays in.  Was there a single 49ers snap that wasn't within 5 seconds of the play clock?  If Harbaugh's staff can't get the call in in that time maybe he needs to get his head out of his ass and stop trying to act like he is smarter than everyone and simplify his shit.

The 49ers were not robbed of anything. First off if not for that power outage I don't even think they are in the game and Secondly you should never leave the game up to a 50/50 call by the refs you need to make plays to win the super bowl and they did not make the plays needed. The 49ers should have seen the huge blitz the ravens had set up and used that last time out instead of throwing up that pass to the corner that crabtree most likely would not have caught anyway. So Congrats to the ravens as much as I hate you im glad to see Ray go out on top and for the 49ers if you keep this team together then you have a very good chance of being back next year.,1359951866.0,1.0,:Patriots: Patriots,Football,3,2N

"OK, I'm partly drunk (thanks, Jameson) but here are my thoughts:

- 49ers play calling was suspect the entire game. They ran all over teams in the playoffs and passed a lot tonight. The play calling when inside the red zone at the end of the game was very questionable. Why not run Kaepernick on an option one of out two times? Made no sense.
- 49ers wasted a huge timeout on that final drive and scored zero points.
- That Crabtree-Smith play at the end reminded me of the Ohio State-Miami BCS title game 10 years ago, except there was a PI call in the college game.
- The power outage really made things lag. How the fuck does that happen? Ravens looked horrible after the outage when they had all the momentum? If 49ers won Ravens fans would have wanted to kill the guys responsible for letting that happen on America's biggest stage.
- Flacco is going to get paid
- 49ers are still too young and will be back
- Wonder how Alex Smith feels right about now
- Commercials sucked for most part. Budweiser clydesdales make me teary eyed =(
- Ray Lewis, I'm glad CBS (and Jim Nantz) cut you off. Shut the fuck up already about God and how he loves you. You were involved in a double murder. You're not a saint.
- Glad Ed Reed won a title. I have always respected his game and his demeanor. True pro.

"I want to share my story, don't even know in which thread to post it. 

My friend asked me to watch superbowl at my other friend's house. Please note that we are all from europe, this was 2nd time that I watched superbowl.

Anyway we came few hours early at our friend's house so we can get ready for the game. Friend who invited me played American football in our local team so mostly we knew the rules of the game because of him, so it's not like that we are completely strangers to the NFL. So it was time to decide who will cheer for which team.

Friend who invited me said that he will cheer for Ravens for some reason and me, other friend and his brother said that we will cheer for 49ers. 

Game started and we were pretty hyped and what not, but as the time went by, 3 of us were getting out of the mood because of the apparent reasons. So we just tried to pay as little attention as possible to the game saying things like, 'Don't be lame it is American football', 'Who cares?!' and what not.

2nd half started with freaking kickoff return td, and all 3 of us were like 'turn this shit off'. 4th one was smiling like a bitch of course.

And then power outage happened. One more break, no big deal. But after that WOW.

First 49ers TD. It's cool at least they got their first TD in the game.

2nd one comes after. YEA, FUCK, WE TOLD YOU, HERE WE GO MOTHERFUCKER.

FIELD GOAL, MAN YOU ARE GETTING FUCKED.

OK, you got one also, big fucking deal.

NEW TD FOR 49ers. High fives around the room, we are jumping like crazy. Shouting at our friend: ""You will get it in the ass"", ""Go in freaking Baltimore so you can cry at Ray Lewis's retirement party with him"", of course in the meantime we are showing him all kinds of rude hand gestures and what not.

So 10 minutes on the clock and we are hyped, we are sure that we can get this. Of course after last failed pass in the end zone we all just sat down knowing that the end result wouldn't be as great as we thought it would be. Lonely Raven fan is waiting for the end so he can finally start celebrating in our face and get some kind of payback. That time comes. He goes: ""Fuck yea, told you so, go Ravens"". All of us looked at him and just said: ""It's just American Football, who cares""... 

Yeah right :)

"I honestly don't think the Ravens deserved to even have been in the Super Bowl. The are NOT the best team in the NFL. Joe Flacco is NOT an elite quarterback.

They got lucky a ton this postseason.

-Against the Broncos in the divisional round, they won because of a freak play by Jacoby Jones and AWFUL coverage by the Broncos DB. Not to mention just a dumb throw by Manning. They should have lost this game.

-In the AFC Championship I honestly believe the Patriots would have taken this game with ease if it weren't for Aqib Talib getting hurt. Look at Boldin's stats (he was covering him) before and after the injury. A great play by Pollard, but I also think they would have lost if Ridley didn't get knocked out. That one obviously is a result of a great hit, but kinda dirty (but legal) and lucky that he blacked out and fumbled because of it.

-In the Super Bowl they got a ton of calls and no-calls that went their way. Yes, there were some they should have got too, the the majority screwed the 49ers over. Williams pretty much punched a ref (no flag), 3rd and goal Crabtree was hit in the facemask as a defenseless reciever by a defender leading with the crown of his helmet (no flag), and lastly on 4th and Goal the DB blatantly held Crabtree (no flag). These both would have resulted in automatic first downs and I'd be willing to bet the 49ers would have scored and won the Super Bowl if either of them were called. They had literally 100% of the momentum and the refs ruined it for them. I can't imagine how tough this is to swallow for a 49ers fan.

But the Ravens won, and that's that. I'm not a 49er fan, Im a Chargers fan, but the Ravens are not close to being the best team in the NFL. Lastly, why the fuck wasn't Jacoby Jones MVP?",1360010390.0,-2.0,,Football,3,2N

I would have put Smith in. It became obvious very early on that Keap wasn't up to the challenge. The only thing that makes him better than Smith is his ability to make plays on the ground when he has to. The Ravens shut that down. Smith is a veteran passer who probably would have made better decisions. It became obvious that the 49ers weren't going to win with the players they had early on. Harbough would have been considered a genius if he had subbed in Smith and he won. He had nothing to lose.,1359957092.0,-3.0,:Cowboys: Cowboys,Football,3,2N

"Ravens did not win. The 49ers did not lose. No Harbaugh was better. The outage had no effect. The game was not a game. It was a reality check for NFL fans. But especially for the NFL. Roger Goodell has a lot of explaining to do, and 90% of questions will be about the officiating crew. In a perfect world, no outage occurred. Ray Lewis did not play in the perfect world, for he was in jail. In the perfect world, Williams was ejected for shoving the official. Beyonce didn't sing in the perfect world. In the world we live in, we got a smack in the face, and Mr Reality said to us ""When you let things get out of hand, you cannot fix them.""

My first thought: on-field refs become basically symbolic.  They're there as figureheads to call obvious penalties and give spectators something to focus on.  The real officiating happens from a team of people watching video feed from all angles.  They tell the on-field refs when to pull flags when the field refs fail.

Also, the refs were incredibly lenient with PI and illegal contact calls throughout the game. They only called it once in the entire game, when there were a few that could have been called.

"As a neutral I have to disagree. 

-Lots of non-called offside in the 4th, mostly from the Ravens. 

-The out of bounds hit on Flaco should have been called (the Ravens took a penalty on a much more marginal hit on Kaepernick). 

-Why can't the NFL accurately spot the damn ball? It's insane that Jim Harbaugh had to challenge that first down call when it was obvious the first time round that the Ravens were short. 

-The non PI call at the end. This one isn't really game specific and would have been controversial either way because the league just doesn't seem to have a consistent policy on what constitutes pass interference. Which is a bit of a problem when one of the most important plays in the biggest game of the year cannot be understood by fans, coaches, commentators or the players themselves. The scoring system in Olympic boxing is more transparent. Hell, why not just spin a big wheel after every passing play?

By the book, that's a penalty. But by the way they refs called the game and what they've allowed, they aren't going to randomly start calling it now. As a coach and a team you have to know you're getting squeezed in the strike zone by the umpire, so you have to be careful with your pitch selection.

If there's no PI called, you can't throw fades. Rip that page right out of your playbook. Do you feel burned, 49er fans? You should. It sucks.

Davis was definitely held on that last goal line drive by the 49ers, but that's not why the 49ers lost the game and any 49ers fan who says so is wrong. The 49ers had the chance to put it away there at the end and screwed it up. They shouldn't have even been in that position but their own mistakes fucked them over.

Overall people are really out there to have fun, no matter what team you root for.

See, if there's a high-profile ~~football~~ *soccer* match over here in the Netherlands (say... Ajax vs. Feyenoord) then you should expect trouble. Fans are kept separated by police, fans don't get to enter the arena at the same locations and basically the whole area is on edge.

Seems *completely* different over there. That NFL live show with fans from both teams just standing around and having fun?  I'd deem that completely impossible over here.

The game has just passed 3 of the 5 by and, unfortunately, those three are the central figures and it is just them trying to out whacky each other. I want football analysts to actually talk about football rather than seeing Terry Bradshaw try to be funny.

"All folks are going to talk about is that penalty, which is a shame.  This was a fantastic game start to finish.  The Eagles could have truly put this to bed with just ONE defensive stop in the second half - which they could not manage.  When the pressure was the greatest the Chiefs stepped up on both sides of the ball, and the Eagles did not.  

At the half it felt like the Eagles were going to break this wide open - they felt dominant, especially when Hurts ran the ball.  He was truly awesome on the ground, and made quite a few big time throws for crucial conversions, but as the game went on it felt like Philly tightened from the top down.  The playcalling got too cute, too much reliance on Hurts' arm, which ain't bad but its not his strength, not when you have to chew clock.  

Its a testament to the Chiefs' resilience, their experience, that brought them this Super Bowl win.  Don't tell me halftime adjustments don't exist, especially when the halftime is twice as long, because the Chiefs came out looking Chiefsy, and the Eagles couldn't match it.",1676258635.0,5.0,:Panthers: Panthers,Football,3,2N

— Eagles get a fast FG and KC still has time to try and win/tie on their next possession

"The problem with reffing continues to be its inconsistency.

If a penalty is a penalty, call that penalty 100% of the time. Force the players to adjust. Holds, PI, offsides, false starts, delay of game - call every single one until the players stop doing it. We saw how defensive backs adjusted their game with the PI rule changes all those years ago. They went from getting called for PI all the time to being the best the NFL has ever seen.

*or*

They need to *only* call the most egregious of penalties. No debate penalties. “That guy got borderline dragged to the turf being held” type of penalties. “That guy was nearly decapitated” penalties.

These “we let them play until we didn’t” penalties absolutely *kill* these games. That was a brutal ending to a great fucking Super Bowl because they suddenly decided they were going to call a different type of game. That is *fucked up*. We are going to be able to go back and rewatch this game and find that same penalty occur and not get called until it was. They need to entirely reevaluate their reffing philosophies. It *cannot* continue to be the middling “sometimes we call it and sometimes we don’t” approach to reffing.

Sometimes I notice they all run super fast to start the next play and other times they go slow? Sometimes the clock runs after a play, sometimes not?


So they get near the end zone, DONT score, and do a 3-point field goal instead, giving the other team less time to score (since after they score the ball goes back to the other team)? That’s it? Are you allowed to go for a 3-point field goal whenever you want?

"I’m a diehard Pats fan. I’ve watched highlights from our Super Bowls more times than I care to admit. One play that I’ll always remember is Julian Edelman scoring the go-ahead TD against the Seahawks in 2014 late in the 4th. 

The reason I bring it up is because he very easily could have been called for an offensive PI after he shoved off his defender to get space on that play. Only the refs didn’t call it because it was the last moments of an epic super bowl, and that’s a 50/50 call any given Sunday so thankfully that ref crew opted to let them play. I would have been salty if it happened to my team, but I would have eventually gotten over it.

I would NEVER get over this if I was an Eagles fan. You cannot throw that flag at that point in the game under those circumstances. It’s the most egregious BS call I have seen in 25 years watching the NFL.",1676258992.0,3.0,:Patriots: Patriots,Football,3,2N

Philadelphia, for whatever reason, just could not defend Kansas City’s whip routes and that’s a big reason they lost this SB. These were easily the two best teams in football and it showed. 

I’ve heard a lot of flak for the Bradberry call - and while it was the wrong call (and uncatchable to boot although it’s possible JuJu gave up on the route. Not 100% sure.) I don’t think it was necessarily egregious or anything. In real time, if a ref sees a hand on the WR’s hip on an overthrow and a little bit of a jersey pull that looks like a hold. Even still, Philly benefited from a few calls that could have gone either way - namely, the Sanders incompletion as well as a couple of uncalled holding penalties on Chris Jones.

"The Eagles defense utterly sucked but Hurts being robbed of a chance to go down and win the game because of a soft ass holding call will hang over this one. Was an all time great Super Bowl and to have the refs interfere like that- like maybe the Chiefs still win! I didnt really care who won, was rooting for KC if anything, but man I feel bad for Hurts not even getting a chance. Should have been 38-35 KC with like 1:40 and 1 timeout for Hurts to have his shot. 

And conspiracy wise it doesnt make sense either- NFL would rather rather have Hurts have a shot to go down and score and add more drama to the end. This was just incompetent reffing. There is no way you call that hold in that situation, it would have been a ticky tack holding call regardless of the situation but just to hand the Chiefs the game like that just makes it more godawful. Only people who liked that ending are Chiefs fans and NFCE fans that aren't Eagles and maybe not all of them.

"What a half. What a half.

Pep going with Gundogan as a defensive midfielder has been a massive issue. They haven’t been able to retrieve the ball early and as a result Chelsea have been able to counter attack, which resulted in the goal.


In addition, Chelsea’s attack has been making very good decisions. Either a good pass forward, or try to keep possession and build slowly if they can’t find a pass. So far the decision making has been tactically spot on.

I think Pep will have to introduce Fernandinho and Jesus. Gundogan or Silva will be off and I think Mahrez or Foden. These decisions will be interesting to keep an eye on.",1622317979.0,14.0,,Soccer,1,2N

The CBs pushing up into midfield and then dropping back when needed is excellent if you have two smart, athletic CBs like Rudiger and Azpillicueta. This could be a new trend now- using CBs that are able to travel up and down the pitch. The three forwards running down the channels fluidly, quick transitions, and lots of running directly at defenders to make them uncomfortable and force them to commit before playing balls into the channels.

It definitely requires certain types of players (lots of athleticism for sure) but it works well.",1622318586.0,11.0,,Soccer,1,2N

"The culture they've established at Chelsea since Abramovich took over is ruthless but they've stuck to it and haven't half arsed it when convenient.

Their recruitment is excellent and consistent, and they don't get sentimental about it. If a player wants to move, then they get a fee for him and move on. They don't get hung up on favouring homegrown players, even though they stockpile a boatload of them, when they aren't good enough. They don't worry about things like having one-club men and move players on when the path forward isn't mutually beneficial. 

As for coaches, everyone knows what they're signing up for now. You're backed with good players and transfer budget. You can't get the players winning then see you later, they'll find someone who can. None of this ""give him time and we'll re-evaluate in 3 seasons"". Expectations are clearly stated at front.


Players that sign for them know what they're signing up for. Managers the same. Whoever is running the football side of things are like complete cold blooded sharks and they're successful.

they didn't 'play bunkerball'  they attacked far better than City,  and far, far more efficiently.

the best way to counter a counter-attacking side is to break the momentum of their counters and reverse the play quickly while they're still caught in their breaking momentum,    without a DM you're handicapping yourself in regards to stealing that possession, and with the Attacking CMs on the flanks constantly dropping deep to retrieve, you have no options to reverse the play.

Stats back it up too with 1 shot on target which never happens for City. And the team didn't have a DM this game. Fans can at least notice when a team is playing differently than before.

Kante wasn’t on this same level even when he played deeper for Lampard because of that reason so I’d attribute it to overall team pressing getting better more than just a positional switch. Tuchel is a brilliant coach.,1622323532.0,5.0,,Soccer,3,2N

"Agree to an extent, we can’t really say what would have happened if X as it’s impossible to know but the way they set up, with that personnel played right into the hands of Chelsea, they offered no protection to the centre halves and defence to the excellent movement that Werner provides. 

That particular move that lead to the goal where they played the switch over to Chilwells side to move the midfield across happened 4/5 times and eventually it drew the mistake from the back 4 of City. The lack of an actual DM in that space massively exposed them to that risk and for me was a risk too far that Pep took. Easy to say in hindsight was to be patient and trust the process that’s got you here by using Fernandinho Or Rodri to control that midfield area by protecting your defence.

Also De Bruyne was the most important player for 5 years I’m not doubting that but tonight he and several others were the heartbeat for a side that bottled it hard and Kante was one of the best players in the team of the new Champions League winners.",1622328142.0,3.0,,Soccer,3,2N

No it makes him a brilliant defensive midfielder. Its an actual position in the midfield. Can he play a ball like Modric? No. Modric clearly has an advantage there and its why he is considered upper echelon as well.

"as someone living in germany: real madrid winning was fucking hilarious and satisfying. ZDF (the german broadcaster) pretty much reported only about liverpool non-stop before kick-off and basically treated them like a German team simply because Klopp manages them. Their bias was fcking ridiculous. even after the match the journalist suggested to kroos that madrid wasn't the better team instead of congratulatin him and talking about the MASSIVE game madrid had. this country is a so-called ""nichts-gönner-land"" (country full of people who always criticize and shit on others and are merely arrogant and bitter people for the most part \[of course there are exceptions, but the mentality here in germany is honestly sickining sometimes\]).  
  
massive respect to madrid. unfortunately they made themselves very likeable to me this season (see flair). insane mentality. i love that they didnt give a fuck about what anyone said. were underestimated four times straight. people wrote them off. people said chelsea would win. people said city would EASILY win this time. people said liverpool is a sure loss for them. i love their ""anti-hero"" arch. in the end they come out on top with a mic drop. stepped out there, followed their game plan, scored with the few chances they had (IMO Benzema's goal should've counted too as the ""pass"" wasn't intended) and defended extremely well against a tough opponent. Deserved win.  
  
also love seeing a spanish side pick up the trophy after everyone's been talking about the ""english"" rise. Leo and cr7 gone and spain still pretty much dominates in europe. how about that?

"Valverde horrible shot or amazing pass? 

I like to think he knew exactly what he was doing. When he first received the ball, he looked up to see Vinicius making the run. Right before he struck the ball, he did a pass fake (watch closely). Either because in that split second he was about to pass it to Benzema then realized he was offside, or was about to cross but was waiting for Vini to get in perfect position. I think he used Benz as bait, luring TAA/Konate in, waiting for Carvajal to make the outside run (which made VD second guess himself as Robertson was out of position), was about to cross (lobbed, I believe, which everyone was expecting), chose not to, then decided to blast it low and across (which nobody was expecting, except for Vinicius) knowing all along who would be there. 

Now, for the sake of argument, let’s say it was a bad shot. If this is the case, then that is a very smartly aimed shot. Meaning, if he was going to miss anywhere, that was the best possible place to miss. I firmly believe he knew a near post shot would have likely been blocked, saved, in the side netting, or in the stands. He knew it had to be far post, but was in a difficult position/situation to score. He decided his best chance was to blast it low, hard, and across the face of goal. That way, even if Alisson gets his gloves on it, there was a chance he would spill the ball from the pace. If he spilled the ball, it would land in the vicinity of Vinicius. So, even if it was a poor shot, it was a smart decision. 

Either way, in my mind, it was a moment of pure brilliance from Federico.

"Unpopular opinion but I felt that trent was the worst performing player in Liverpool. He made some incredible passes but his defensive work was.... horrendous... with exception to some of his amazing passes, he always loses the ball with simple passes. He was also visibly losing his cool and focus later in the second half after they conceded. 

Konate in particular was a beast. He anticipated so many through balls to Vini and Benzema. He made great runs from the back and brought the ball forward numerous times. Van Djik did amazing long passes from the back. But Real Madrid midfield was too good. Modric was dancing around, Casemiro with great tackles and Kroos was just the perfect midfielder. Robertson tried to keep Valverde out of the game but Valverde slips past him in some occasions, and it lead to the goal. But the goal, Trent was caught ball watching and was marking Benzema while Konate was already doing it, leaving space for Vini to run into and score. Real Madrid defence was absolutely bonkers. Both teams defence were excellent but Liverpool had some defensive cracks, Carvajal was world class, his anticipation and strength, absolutely disgusting. Kept Luis Diaz out of the game. Mendy was good but had the occasional mispositioning which left Salah to do his thing but Courtois was THE BEAST. I think Mane used all his energy in the first half and he was quite invisible in the second half as compared to his first half performance.",1653804952.0,40.0,,Soccer,3,2N

"as someone living in germany: real madrid winning was fucking hilarious and satisfying. ZDF (the german broadcaster) pretty much reported only about liverpool non-stop before kick-off and basically treated them like a German team simply because Klopp manages them. Their bias was fcking ridiculous. even after the match the journalist suggested to kroos that madrid wasn't the better team instead of congratulatin him and talking about the MASSIVE game madrid had. this country is a so-called ""nichts-gönner-land"" (country full of people who always criticize and shit on others and are merely arrogant and bitter people for the most part \[of course there are exceptions, but the mentality here in germany is honestly sickining sometimes\]).

massive respect to madrid. unfortunately they made themselves very likeable to me this season (see flair). insane mentality. i love that they didnt give a fuck about what anyone said. were underestimated four times straight. people wrote them off. people said chelsea would win. people said city would EASILY win this time. people said liverpool is a sure loss for them. i love their ""anti-hero"" arch. in the end they come out on top with a mic drop. stepped out there, followed their game plan, scored with the few chances they had (IMO Benzema's goal should've counted too as the ""pass"" wasn't intended) and defended extremely well against a tough opponent. Deserved win.

also love seeing a spanish side pick up the trophy after everyone's been talking about the ""english"" rise. Leo and cr7 gone and spain still pretty much dominates in europe. how about that?

"There’s so much to say man.

Courtois easily motm, that was the best goalkeeping performance I’ve ever watched he should be top 5 at least for balon dor.

Although Liverpool had a lot of shots only a few of them were actually good chances like that mane one in the first half and the salah one in the 2nd. We once again showed how clinical we are tonight, literally first shot on target and it’s a goal lol. Valverde did brilliantly the whole match and leading up to that goal; Vini wasn’t at his best but it doesn’t matter he scored the winner what a season he’s had!! 

Carvajal was absolutely incredible single-handedly pocketed Diaz, what a return of form he had this season. Our whole defence especially in the second half was brilliant blocked sooo many shots and won so many headers, our low block compact defensive shape is so underrated 

Casemiro showed once again why he’s the best cdm in the world his defensive contributions for us is second to none, the amount of times he stole the ball of a Liverpool player or intercepted a pass or blocked a shot man he was phenomenal

For all the shit KCM got this season they dominated the midfield especially in the second half, the way kroos and modric would dance around Liverpool players or ping a 40 yard pass to get out of a press was beautiful. Kroos had such a great game too I can’t remember a single time he lost the ball under pressure from Liverpool’s suffocating press, best passer itw

While benzema didn’t score (should’ve with that offside one tho) he was still great, coming back to pick up the ball, helping relieve pressure etc. 

Vini was being defended brilliantly by konate but he still dribbled past him a few times and scored the winner lmao this kid improved so much this season it’s astounding. Trent completely lost him for that goal too lollll

A wonderful, dramatic and above all ass clencher of a season has come to a beautiful ending, commiserations to Liverpool they had a good season too

"Couple questions, especially for those that can be unbiased - first though, I am a Liverpool fan but I’m also pretty skeptical of my teams in any sport - but for all the talk about this team being one of the best ever, is that statement true? 3 finals, no goals, drew against City, Tottenham and Chelsea this year. Sure, they beat up lesser opponents but it seems that in big games, they don’t come through. Is it a factor if they aren’t as good as the “experts” say or is it that they run in to teams as talented as they are? 

Also, as much as TAA is a playmaker, his defensive lapses seem to come at the wrong time and/or are big lapses. Also helps that our two CBs provide him a ton of cover. So, is he as good as the experts say? 

And finally, a bit more of a statement but would welcome thoughts, can we just get a midfielder that can break down the low block? Someone with some creativity? I know Thiago has some of that passing creativity but something is lacking in the final third. Does Liverpool need a true striker? 

I know this might be better suited for the Liverpool board but I want some other opinions, like I said I can be critical of my team so would like other fans’ opinions.",1653777978.0,15.0,:r_soccer_user:,Soccer,3,2N

"*Some thoughts on the game...*

* Very strange game that feels like it was played at about 75% intensity for the first half. Not sure if it was because of the delayed kick off or both sides being knackered but it definitely didn't feel like either side were at their best.

* Salah and Vinicius both struggled for much of the game but Trent and Mendy defended excellently too. In fact both sets of fullbacks were very good all game. Well almost...Trent had a very good game defensively but got caught out once and you're going to get punished at this level.

* Standouts were Courtois (what a save that was from the Mane shot) and Konate for me. The former's positioning was spot on all game and he did well to play it out of danger when pressed. Konate on the other hand was imperious- great on and off the ball.

* Our delivery all game was terrible. From corners, free kicks, and crosses. It was the best place to hurt Real Madrid and we butchered it horribly. 

* When you're up a goal there are very few players better than Modric and Benzema are relieving pressure. Anything at their feet was immediately brought under control and a pass was found. 

* In the end, there was no Real Madrid 'juju', they defended well and took their chance when they had it and desrevedly got the win. 

* As for Liverpool, I think we made enough chances to win it but ulimately took the wrong option too often and came across a keeper in incredible form.

* Courtois clear man of the match.",1653773690.0,3.0,:c_Liverpool:,Soccer,3,2F

Think Klopp kinda bottled the subs a bit. Jota on for Diaz doesn't work when you're chasing a game, imo, as he's a better counter player and Liverpool needed someone who could trap the ball in the final third like Firmino. Salah was quite poor today, I thought, but I understand that it's hard to sub off a player that can create chances from almost nothing.

Some poor decision-making from Liverpool players as well when they got into actual good positions, while Real were mostly clinical (though they could have made it 2 and 3 but fucked it with the final decisions).

Real just had that CL voodoo and as soon as they scored first, you could just feel 1-0 at full time coming. Congrats to them.",1653774176.0,4.0,:pride::Arsenal:,Soccer,3,2N

They took their only other chance of genuine quality and from there Liverpool couldn't match them unfortunately. It was a great game absorbing to fuck and both sides deserve massive credit. I do feel though that with the delay, I think Liverpool were ready to really go at the time the game should have kicked off and the delay unfortunately killed it for us.

Having him inside helped protect against counter-attacks and control possession but it dramatically reduced their ability to create more danger.

I think he overlapped Salah 4-5 times at most all game and it allowed Mendy and Alaba or (one of the CMs) to double up on Salah all game long. It also meant one of their most dangerous outlets (TAA's crossing) was very limited.

I think the fact Liverpool went so long without winning anything has clouded perception around the current team, for example as an opposing fan I feared Alex Ferguson's Man Utd much more than I do Klopp's Liverpool, and then you have the Wenger Invincibles, Mourinho's Chelsea and the current City team as Premier League teams from the past 20 years alone you'd have a very strong case for saying were better.

"Don't think it's one of the best ever as things go because they haven't won enough. Liverpool used to suffer from being inconsistent in the ""smaller"" games and steamrolling in the bigger games, and now it's the opposite.

I think Trent gets alot of unwarranted stick for his lack of positioning defensively, but that's just an effect of when you play so high up. However I think he was at fault for the goal

And I think Liverpool do need something extra in midfield, but to be honest I'm not even sure what type of profile fits what they need, because on paper Thiago should solve the low-block. Keita simply hasn't been good enough (he does have flashes of brilliance), it could just be another player who can unlock a defence, but sometimes I think it's the way our front 3 plays that makes it easier to defend against in a low block

And I support Liverpool so that's just my take",1653778614.0,2.0,,Soccer,3,2N

For what it’s worth, we have Kroos, Modric, & Benzema and breaking down low blocks are still a pain in the ass. 2020 was so painful re: low blocks. The best method we’ve found has actually been a Vini/ Salah type who carries the ball *into* said low block and disrupts it. You need to move the organized low block out of position.

PL you can just  
consider a tournament that only clubs that can spend £10 million + on transfers  
and monthly wages can win. With the exception of Leicester, it hasn't had one  
winner on football merit in its history.  
CL is just a  
preseason friendly tournament which was injected with all the greed and money  
that is running football. The only people who want to win it are super rich  
Russian oligarchs and Arab oil barons.

"NOT A LIVERPOOL FAN BUT:

>Easy path

Every year someone’s gotta have easier path, comes down to luck

>Overrated players, Arnold specifically

They are not overrated, they contesting first place in probably the strongest league, got to final of CL, won both in recent years, meaninf players are good. Arnold had an okay game, he made 1 mistake which shouldn’t have been decision making if Liverpool capitalized on so many great chances. 

>Jurgen

Has taken 2 teams that were not the best and made them either the best or contesting the beat in League and being a candidate for CL title, he is a great coach, and tries to say things as he sees them. I’d say based on his accomplishments his words have merrit.

>VAR

So what? I thought VAR is in most cases pretty much right. Yesterday we had clear enforcment of know rules and people ranted it wasn’t an offside even tho by rules it classifies as such. Even if it was in their favor when it shouldn’t gave been that’s not on the team but refs making these decisions. Real straight up won CL based on terrible ref decisions

"What? Too much time wasting lol. That much for being a football watcher. If you call this too much time wasting, than you dont really watch football. 

Secondly, this is how football has been. You convert goals, you win. If you can't covert them you lose, you can play the most beautiful football in the world doesnt matter if you dont score.

But yeah yeah, Real is always the team playing the worse football but somehow beat PSG, Chelsea, City and Liverpool. Must be a coincidence or something.

"yeah, like I can simultaneously congratulate Madrid on a very difficult UCL run this year, and their incredible record in this past decade, because it is insanely impressive of course, and be pretty sad and pissed that they now:
- won UCL 5 of the last 9 years.
- won their 14th UCL. the next closest team is AC Milan with 7.
- won 14 of their 17 visits to the final ever.
- have not lost in a final for over 40 years.
- have Casemiro, Kroos and Modric for a decade, follow that up with Valverde, Camavinga, Tchouameni in midfield.

its getting pretty boring as a neutral tbh. insanely impressive of course, just boring.",1653799362.0,7.0,:Bayern_Munich:,Soccer,3,2N
