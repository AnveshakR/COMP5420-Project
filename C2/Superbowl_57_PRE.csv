Overall people are really out there to have fun, no matter what team you root for.

See, if there's a high-profile ~~football~~ *soccer* match over here in the Netherlands (say... Ajax vs. Feyenoord) then you should expect trouble. Fans are kept separated by police, fans don't get to enter the arena at the same locations and basically the whole area is on edge.

Seems *completely* different over there. That NFL live show with fans from both teams just standing around and having fun?  I'd deem that completely impossible over here.
