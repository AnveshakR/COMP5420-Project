Gündo, Bernardo, Foden and de Bruyne were all drifting around the attacking midfield aimlessly with no anchor, and meanwhile Chelsea were winning pretty much every important battle in midfield (90% of this being due to Kante, in fairness, but City has their Kante equivalents and opted not to play them). The idea was to overload Chelsea with possession and offensive pressure but they were barely able to maintain the majority of the ball so it fell totally flat.

Reece James and Chillwell nullified everything Mahrez and Sterling could throw at them.

Jorginho and later Kovacic essential to keeping possession.

Thiago Silva, unfortunately injured but didn't put a foot wrong beforehand.

Rudiger withe perfect last ditch block on Foden.

Azpilicueta with a proper captain's display, last line of defence, and pushing forward as well.

Mendy, not having much to do tbh but took care of all crosses, slowed the tempo down and made good passes whenever needed.

Andreas Christensen comes on in such a high stakes match, doesn't put a foot wrong at all.

This wasn't the game to fuck around with. 2 billion in player purchases now since they were relevant and still no European success.

Part of me is also just glad that this game between these two teams who I couldn't decided I wanted to lose more is over. This will be a tough one to take for Pep. Just strengthens the argument that he's not won the big one without Messi.",1622321990.0,98,:Brighton_Hove_Albion:

I don't think there's any club in the world that wouldn't struggle against them with how they played tonight.

Certainly not playing a man like Fernandinho was suspect with how well Chelsea counter attacked in this game, but City literally couldn't do anything in the final third.  Chelsea simply defended great, Pep's lineup choice wasn't going to change much.",1622322905.0,12,:Bayern_Munich:

It was obvious after the first 20 minutes when Werner should have scored twice that it wasn't the right decision, and waiting until the 64th minute to get Fernandinho on was a huge mistake. Chelsea didn't create as much in the second half even before he came on, but they didn't have to, because City were toothless in attack too.

Rudiger's challenge on De Bruyne was dirty and you can't prepare for your best creative midfielder being taken out of the game in that way, but he wasn't playing well anyway and City's attack and midfield was unbalanced all night. 

There was a little bit of luck involved in Chelsea's goal, but it was possible for that chance to be created because of the mess in midfield that Guardiola's line up exposed. Tuchel's tactics can't be ignored, but Guardiola's choices made it much easier for him to get Chelsea in control of the game and snuff City out.",1622323698.0,7,:Juventus:

I kept hearing people compare this to 2012 when that’s not the case. In every single tie Chelsea was the better team easily… that wasn’t the case in 2012. Part of it is PSG being massively over rated and city beating them comfortably. 

I think Pep tinkering may not have helped the team… but he actually appreciated that even had city went in with their normal XI it may not have been enough. People keep saying if Fernandinho played or Rodri played or Aguero played. If the first two played they would have been over ran in the midfield and if aguero played he wouldn’t have done much against Chelsea’s cbs who cleaned everything up.

"The culture they've established at Chelsea since Abramovich took over is ruthless but they've stuck to it and haven't half arsed it when convenient.

Their recruitment is excellent and consistent, and they don't get sentimental about it. If a player wants to move, then they get a fee for him and move on. They don't get hung up on favouring homegrown players, even though they stockpile a boatload of them, when they aren't good enough. They don't worry about things like having one-club men and move players on when the path forward isn't mutually beneficial. 

As for coaches, everyone knows what they're signing up for now. You're backed with good players and transfer budget. You can't get the players winning then see you later, they'll find someone who can. None of this ""give him time and we'll re-evaluate in 3 seasons"". Expectations are clearly stated at front.


Players that sign for them know what they're signing up for. Managers the same. Whoever is running the football side of things are like complete cold blooded sharks and they're successful.

Im sure Chelsea have more trophies now than United since Abramovich took over. Sir Alex had 49 trophies - I don't know how many Chelsea have under Abramovich but I feel like they will definitely get there, albeit with 30 managers or whatever...",1622363720.0,1,:Manchester_United:

"It was an idiotic decision...  a DM is the perfect countermeasure to a fast-countering side.    Chelsea just ended up carrying the ball all the way to City's third every time they attacked.  because they're a good counter-attackign side.. 

they didn't 'play bunkerball'  they attacked far better than City,  and far, far more efficiently.

the best way to counter a counter-attacking side is to break the momentum of their counters and reverse the play quickly while they're still caught in their breaking momentum,    without a DM you're handicapping yourself in regards to stealing that possession, and with the Attacking CMs on the flanks constantly dropping deep to retrieve, you have no options to reverse the play.

Stats back it up too with 1 shot on target which never happens for City. And the team didn't have a DM this game. Fans can at least notice when a team is playing differently than before. And the fact that there was a big tactical change means its not unreasonable connect the tactic change to performance change. Pep is responsible for the tactics.

"After a while the wins matter more. Tuchel is not always bunkerball but more of a video game Min - Max guy. He tries to allow no shots at all and then on opposite end create as much clear cut chances as possible in space. His current attackers have no composure otherwise you’d see more 2-0, 3-0 or 3-1 games from Chelsea.  

Playing against city who have hundreds of matches of  experience in playing a controlling possession game, if you don’t feel confident in playing that style as well you setup exactly like Chelsea did. Do you want to win matches or be brave for being brave’s sake and always win silver medals?",1622324081.0,4,:Chelsea:
"Tuchel is far from a bunkerball manager.

The way his three centrebacks play is incredibly daring because two of the three are expected to have aggression and awareness to push forward to a CM space and intercept dangerous passing options before they happen.  That’s the antithesis of a bunkerball. This game it was Rüdiger stepping forward most of the time but Azpilicueta also played that part on the right hand side.  Rüdiger and Azpi also step up when the team has the ball to assist the attacking build up. 

Even attacking coaches like Bielsa have a rule of deploying a spare defender against the number of opposing forwards.  But Tuchel is known for setting up his defense in one on one duels if it comes to it.  It’s ridiculously ballsy to set up your team to win 1v1 duels versus elite teams.",1622331653.0,4,

It’s more that Chelsea’s pressing under Lampard was terribly disorganized and that made it really easy for opposition to bypass Kante’s immense presence. Chelsea’s pressing under Tuchel is on point and really seals off the options preemptively and Kante can really shine in breaking up play.

"Agree to an extent, we can’t really say what would have happened if X as it’s impossible to know but the way they set up, with that personnel played right into the hands of Chelsea, they offered no protection to the centre halves and defence to the excellent movement that Werner provides. 

That particular move that lead to the goal where they played the switch over to Chilwells side to move the midfield across happened 4/5 times and eventually it drew the mistake from the back 4 of City. The lack of an actual DM in that space massively exposed them to that risk and for me was a risk too far that Pep took. Easy to say in hindsight was to be patient and trust the process that’s got you here by using Fernandinho Or Rodri to control that midfield area by protecting your defence.

dude was a main team pl player since 18-19 yrs age. he's not bang average but he didn't improve much since going to city unlike what I've seen people say when he's in form.,1622325586.0,42,:Liverpool:
He was kinda decent for a couple of seasons but even then his finishing was quite dodgy. Pep rates him for his work rate and off the ball intelligence but I don't think it made any sense to move away from the formula that got them to the CL final to begin with just to accommodate another attacker.,1622322954.0,26,:Manchester_United:
"He’s also legitimately one of the worst (professional) strikers of the ball I’ve ever seen. Even his short passes are poor; I mean balls in to space for his teammates are somehow bouncing from his poor technique.

I like watching him dribble because the amount of steps and touches that he takes in a short time is dizzying to watch…but the ball away, shot or pass, is usually painful.",1622351972.0,3,:Manchester_United:

But every coach but one gets eliminated from the CL every year. Lots of teams are desperately looking for a coach as good as Pep. To think that it's a better idea to get someone new than to hope he'll take this extremely talented and very well coached team one step further is ridiculous to me.

Think PSG is happy that they ""upgraded"" from Tuchel?",1622326969.0,2,:SC_Freiburg:

"Also wouldn’t fight that. They were fantastic and I’m not trying to take anything from them. I said as much in my previous comment about them playing possession etc. 
I love tuchel and Kante and honestly that whole Chelsea team is just stacked defensively as well. I’m Moreso, defending city a bit. 
I don’t think I’ve stated that they only play bunker, or that is something negative against them. Even in my original downvoted comment, it was positive toward Chelsea’s decision and just really talked about that pep expected tuchel to line up like that in this game.",1622509671.0,1,

"Tactic is just one aspect, and Pep is not high in the list either.

You want tactic? You want to see which coach that has overturned the game from trailing position to win with the right substitutions.

"is he? or does depth, and hence resource disparity become a lot harder to overcome over a 38 game season. Klopp acheived similar domestic success(198 points over two seasons) with far less resources(distant third in wages, not even top 5 in net spend) and with a club that was saved off relegation and was worried about being relegated literally broke the bundesliga points record b2b.

It's one thing to say pep is a good-great coach, it's another to put him above coaches who've demonstrated they can achieve simialr success with a lot less(tuchel, klopp, peak mou, ect) just because he happens to  have been on more title teams.",1622325993.0,6,

Beating atlético was impressive, you played Porto, and Real Madrid was absolutely battered and injury ridden. You won but it was more luck and great tactics than you guys being this great exciting side. It’s so boring to watch you guys with the exception of you guys beating Real Madrid soundly. If Lewandowski didn’t get injured either, you lot wouldn’t have standed a chance against Bayern, the real best team in Europe.

His 2008/09 side had them losing Ronaldinho,  Deco, Zambrotta, Thuram. They brought in Pique, Keita, Alves, and I think Hleb. It's not that simple to deal with those changes, even if you've got Xavi, Iniesta, and Messi. 

Rijkaard could have played Busquets, but he didn't, Pep promoted him. 

I don't think it's too generous at all, sure he was lucky with Messi, but he did incredibly well at Barcelona to turn them into a winning machine.  He almost won 2 trebles in 3 years. It's not just having good players that lets you do that.

I don't even rate Guardiola that highly, but I don't like discounting his Barcelona stint. His setup brought the best out of their players and set up their future success. I definitely see the point of how much it helps to have Messi.",1622329544.0,7,:r_soccer_user:

Pep is obviously a far, far more knowledgeable person than anyone here when it comes to this thinking, but his approach from that start here feels just like a risk too far to me and hugely incongruent with their approach this season of trying to control games and limit exposure to the counter.",1622325933.0,3,:Luton_Town:

"I absolutely know. Tuchel set it up really well. It is absolutely still classified as a bunker, as they would bunker down most of the game, and park the bus when necessary. for the love of love watch a vid on bunkering, and watch back the tactics with this specific game. and once again, in this game, those CBs were primarily way back. Yes, when they went for the ball, someone had to cover kante. Chelsea do not often play the way they did in this game. against  RM, they played possession based, and their CBs go way forward and dont just pass to the channels. Also, to address your last sentence, the system they played did do a great job. I think tuchel is amazing",1622344489.0,0,

Kante is extremely crucial to Chelsea’s current success and should be recognised for it rather than the amount of goals and assists he makes.  He’s the heartbeat that powers the rest of the team.",1622327249.0,2,

">Bruh they’re all midfielders but they all play wildly different roles.  

They are both CMs. De Bruyne is a better CM than Kante.

>How can you compare Kante to De Bruyne when one is a creator and another a pocket rocket bulldozer? 

They don't need to be 1:1 re: role to compare them. If you're comparing a striker to a defender, sure, it's tricky. But they're both bloody midfielders, use your head.

>Technical ability and skill is an important aspect in a great player however regardless of that the importance of a player to the success of a team is more important.  

De Bruyne has been the best player in the Premier League for five years.

>He’s the heartbeat that powers the rest of the team.

He's the heartbeat for a side that scraped into the top 4 (after a bottlejob by Leicester) and lost the FA Cup final to the underdogs. Glowing endorsement that.",1622327531.0,-1,

“They’re both CM’s, De Bruyne is a better CM than Kante”. Sorry but it’s not nearly as black and white as that even if I wish it were.
By that logic Kante, Pogba, Bruno, Lampard, Vieira, Gerrard, Keane....etc they were all “bloody midfielders” so they are all similar and played similar roles when they were all clearly different in their own ways? Utter nonsense.

Also De Bruyne was the most important player for 5 years I’m not doubting that but tonight he and several others were the heartbeat for a side that bottled it hard and Kante was one of the best players in the team of the new Champions League winners.",1622328142.0,3,

No it makes him a brilliant defensive midfielder. Its an actual position in the midfield. Can he play a ball like Modric? No. Modric clearly has an advantage there and its why he is considered upper echelon as well. But in his midfield role Kanté is several orders of magnitude above him.,1622328191.0,2,:Chelsea:
