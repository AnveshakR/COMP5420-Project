"as someone living in germany: real madrid winning was fucking hilarious and satisfying. ZDF (the german broadcaster) pretty much reported only about liverpool non-stop before kick-off and basically treated them like a German team simply because Klopp manages them. Their bias was fcking ridiculous. even after the match the journalist suggested to kroos that madrid wasn't the better team instead of congratulatin him and talking about the MASSIVE game madrid had. this country is a so-called ""nichts-g√∂nner-land"" (country full of people who always criticize and shit on others and are merely arrogant and bitter people for the most part \[of course there are exceptions, but the mentality here in germany is honestly sickining sometimes\]).  
  
massive respect to madrid. unfortunately they made themselves very likeable to me this season (see flair). insane mentality. i love that they didnt give a fuck about what anyone said. were underestimated four times straight. people wrote them off. people said chelsea would win. people said city would EASILY win this time. people said liverpool is a sure loss for them. i love their ""anti-hero"" arch. in the end they come out on top with a mic drop. stepped out there, followed their game plan, scored with the few chances they had (IMO Benzema's goal should've counted too as the ""pass"" wasn't intended) and defended extremely well against a tough opponent. Deserved win.  
  
also love seeing a spanish side pick up the trophy after everyone's been talking about the ""english"" rise. Leo and cr7 gone and spain still pretty much dominates in europe. how about that?
