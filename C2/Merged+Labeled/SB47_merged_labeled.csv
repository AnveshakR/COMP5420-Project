1. Of the total commercials in the first half of play, which will be represented more; beer or cars? 5 years ago, this was an even split…4 to 4, then 2 years of 5-3 for cars…2 years ago 11-3 in favor of cars, and last year cars big again.  So, we set a line. **Choose one:  Cars – 3.5 over Beer.**

2. Predict the total verbal or image references during the game for an all new episode of ELEMENTARY, coming up on CBS right after the game. This includes commercials. **The over/under is 6 and ½.**

3. Predict the total verbal or image references during the game for the CBS Monday night comedy lineup (any reference to HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, 2 BROKE GIRLS, MIKE AND MOLLY, RULES OF ENGAGEMENT) Same rules as above. A commercial referencing more than 1 of the shows still counts as just 1. **The over/under is 7 and 1/2.**

4. Predict the total number of camera shots of Proud Papa Jack Harbaugh, in his seat or box during the game.  **The over/under is 3 and ½.**

5. Predict the total number of pictures or videos showing young Jim and John Harbaugh.  **The over/under is 1 and 1/2.**

6. Any mention of the word “Pistol,” or reference to the “Pistol formation,” by Phil Simms, Jim Nantz, Steve Tasker, or Solomon Wilcots.  **The over/under is 6 and ½.**

7.  Predict how many times annoying rube Phil Simms will admit he was wrong about something.  This includes past documented instances like “my bad,” “I don’t know what I was thinking,” “check that,” and “forget it,” or other new and thrilling examples.   **The over/under is 1 and 1/2.**

8. . Still images or video of Ray Lewis as a younger Baltimore Raven.  This could be a shot of him in Super Bowl, XXXV, or perhaps his first career sack, of Colts QB Jim Harbaugh.    **he over/under is 1 and 1/2.**

9.  Total number of verbal or image references to either former 49’er QBs Joe Montana or Steve Young.  “Young Colin Kaepernick is in some good company…”  **The over/under is 1 and ½.**

10. Name 3 former super bowl winning coaches who will be mentioned by name.

They make eye contact, and Smith slowly but sternly raises his middle finger, flips the bird, and ends the play 1 yard short of the Super Bowl Championship.

The Ravens stream onto the field to celebrate, as Smith moseys back into the locker room. The entire team is defeated; heads are hanging, sobs can be heard, and Harbaugh is in shock. 

From the corner, barely visible through the crowds of reporters and players, Alex Smith cackles maniacally. ",1359984538.0,79.0,:Vikings: Vikings,Football,3,N

1) The Ravens screwed up my Super Pick Em horribly throughout the playoffs. Ugh!

2) Though I don't think it changed the outcome of the game, I think the refs should have tried harder to pretend to be unbiased. That last holding call is the one people will talk about, but there were 2 no calls on pass interference early that gave the Ravens another shot when they shouldn't have had it.

3) I still don't think Flacco is an elite quarterback. I place him in the same tier as Eli Manning.

4) The 49ers have a lot to look forward to in the next few years. I'm not sure CK can keep taking hits like he did, but they should be good for a while.

5) Can safeties really just not defend deep passes from Flacco? Some of these in the postseason have been just _horrible_.

MOST IMPORTANTLY) Congrats to the Ravens (sans Ray Lewis, but that's a personal bias)! The played to win, and that's exactly what they did. Even if the 49ers score on their last drive, they still give Flacco 1:30 to get the ball in field goal range, and I think they would have pulled through.",1359950572.0,12.0,:Seahawks: Seahawks,Football,3,N

"I think football is as fun and exciting as the next guy, but this super bowl really showed how bullshit it can be. So many calls in this sport can go either way and they all have such a huge impact on the game. Pass interference, holding, these types of calls can drastically change the outcome of the game, even if it isn't a big yardage play. And in many close scenarios it is a fucking toss up as to whether it will be called or not.

 In other sports refereeing is important, but getting a ball or strike wrong in baseball usually does not have close to the size of impact a blown football call would have, you can even argue making slight adjustments to an umpires strike zone is a big part of the game. In sports like hockey, basketball, soccer making the right calls is still very important, but again most rarely have the impact a call or no call would have in a football game. On top of this football calls seem to be so much more subjective. 

Half the time a game is decently close, it seems all people talk about is the bad calls or no calls. Sometimes this sport leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth.",1359953219.0,8.0,,Football,3,N

"Just a few thoughts on the holding ""no-call""

1) Sure, it was holding...but there were plenty of calls that weren't made. It was a loosely called game but that's not exactly a bad thing because it was relatively consistent.

2) They let the game end on the players terms which, in my opinion, makes the ending of the game more desirable than if a flag was thrown. I didn't want to spend the next 15 years watching highlights of that Super Bowl with a slow-mo clip of flags being thrown.

3) You can shit on the refs for that call all you want, but the 9ers offensive put itself in that position with poor playcalling, notably Kaepernick not being able to read/adjust to the Ravens BLATANT show of the house blitz.

The entire fucking secondary needs to be shipped out and players brought in who don't depend on not getting called for interference and big hits.  Kaepernick may have the big arm bit hopefully at some point his brain moves from his biceps to his head.  Two wasted timeouts because this team can't figure out how to get the damn plays in.  Was there a single 49ers snap that wasn't within 5 seconds of the play clock?

The 49ers were not robbed of anything. First off if not for that power outage I don't even think they are in the game and Secondly you should never leave the game up to a 50/50 call by the refs you need to make plays to win the super bowl and they did not make the plays needed. The 49ers should have seen the huge blitz the ravens had set up and used that last time out instead of throwing up that pass to the corner that crabtree most likely would not have caught anyway.

"OK, I'm partly drunk (thanks, Jameson) but here are my thoughts:

- 49ers play calling was suspect the entire game. They ran all over teams in the playoffs and passed a lot tonight. The play calling when inside the red zone at the end of the game was very questionable. Why not run Kaepernick on an option one of out two times? Made no sense.
- 49ers wasted a huge timeout on that final drive and scored zero points.
- That Crabtree-Smith play at the end reminded me of the Ohio State-Miami BCS title game 10 years ago, except there was a PI call in the college game.
- The power outage really made things lag. How the fuck does that happen? Ravens looked horrible after the outage when they had all the momentum? If 49ers won Ravens fans would have wanted to kill the guys responsible for letting that happen on America's biggest stage.
- Flacco is going to get paid
- 49ers are still too young and will be back
- Wonder how Alex Smith feels right about now
- Commercials sucked for most part. Budweiser clydesdales make me teary eyed =(
- Ray Lewis, I'm glad CBS (and Jim Nantz) cut you off. Shut the fuck up already about God and how he loves you. You were involved in a double murder. You're not a saint.
- Glad Ed Reed won a title. I have always respected his game and his demeanor. True pro.

"I want to share my story, don't even know in which thread to post it. 

My friend asked me to watch superbowl at my other friend's house. Please note that we are all from europe, this was 2nd time that I watched superbowl.

Anyway we came few hours early at our friend's house so we can get ready for the game. Friend who invited me played American football in our local team so mostly we knew the rules of the game because of him, so it's not like that we are completely strangers to the NFL. So it was time to decide who will cheer for which team.

Friend who invited me said that he will cheer for Ravens for some reason and me, other friend and his brother said that we will cheer for 49ers. 

Game started and we were pretty hyped and what not, but as the time went by, 3 of us were getting out of the mood because of the apparent reasons. So we just tried to pay as little attention as possible to the game saying things like, 'Don't be lame it is American football', 'Who cares?!' and what not.

2nd half started with freaking kickoff return td, and all 3 of us were like 'turn this shit off'. 4th one was smiling like a bitch of course.

And then power outage happened. One more break, no big deal. But after that WOW.

First 49ers TD. It's cool at least they got their first TD in the game.

2nd one comes after. YEA, FUCK, WE TOLD YOU, HERE WE GO MOTHERFUCKER.

FIELD GOAL, MAN YOU ARE GETTING FUCKED.

OK, you got one also, big fucking deal.

NEW TD FOR 49ers. High fives around the room, we are jumping like crazy. Shouting at our friend: ""You will get it in the ass"", ""Go in freaking Baltimore so you can cry at Ray Lewis's retirement party with him"", of course in the meantime we are showing him all kinds of rude hand gestures and what not.

So 10 minutes on the clock and we are hyped, we are sure that we can get this. Of course after last failed pass in the end zone we all just sat down knowing that the end result wouldn't be as great as we thought it would be. Lonely Raven fan is waiting for the end so he can finally start celebrating in our face and get some kind of payback. That time comes. He goes: ""Fuck yea, told you so, go Ravens"". All of us looked at him and just said: ""It's just American Football, who cares""... 

Yeah right :)

"I honestly don't think the Ravens deserved to even have been in the Super Bowl. The are NOT the best team in the NFL. Joe Flacco is NOT an elite quarterback.

They got lucky a ton this postseason.

-Against the Broncos in the divisional round, they won because of a freak play by Jacoby Jones and AWFUL coverage by the Broncos DB. Not to mention just a dumb throw by Manning. They should have lost this game.

-In the AFC Championship I honestly believe the Patriots would have taken this game with ease if it weren't for Aqib Talib getting hurt. Look at Boldin's stats (he was covering him) before and after the injury. A great play by Pollard, but I also think they would have lost if Ridley didn't get knocked out. That one obviously is a result of a great hit, but kinda dirty (but legal) and lucky that he blacked out and fumbled because of it.

-In the Super Bowl they got a ton of calls and no-calls that went their way. Yes, there were some they should have got too, the the majority screwed the 49ers over. Williams pretty much punched a ref (no flag), 3rd and goal Crabtree was hit in the facemask as a defenseless reciever by a defender leading with the crown of his helmet (no flag), and lastly on 4th and Goal the DB blatantly held Crabtree (no flag). These both would have resulted in automatic first downs and I'd be willing to bet the 49ers would have scored and won the Super Bowl if either of them were called. They had literally 100% of the momentum and the refs ruined it for them. I can't imagine how tough this is to swallow for a 49ers fan.

But the Ravens won, and that's that. I'm not a 49er fan, Im a Chargers fan, but the Ravens are not close to being the best team in the NFL. Lastly, why the fuck wasn't Jacoby Jones MVP?",1360010390.0,-2.0,,Football,3,N

I would have put Smith in. It became obvious very early on that Keap wasn't up to the challenge. The only thing that makes him better than Smith is his ability to make plays on the ground when he has to. The Ravens shut that down. Smith is a veteran passer who probably would have made better decisions. It became obvious that the 49ers weren't going to win with the players they had early on. Harbough would have been considered a genius if he had subbed in Smith and he won. He had nothing to lose.,1359957092.0,-3.0,:Cowboys: Cowboys,Football,3,N

"Ravens did not win. The 49ers did not lose. No Harbaugh was better. The outage had no effect. The game was not a game. It was a reality check for NFL fans. But especially for the NFL. Roger Goodell has a lot of explaining to do, and 90% of questions will be about the officiating crew. In a perfect world, no outage occurred. Ray Lewis did not play in the perfect world, for he was in jail. In the perfect world, Williams was ejected for shoving the official. Beyonce didn't sing in the perfect world. In the world we live in, we got a smack in the face, and Mr Reality said to us ""When you let things get out of hand, you cannot fix them.""  
Congratulations Roger Goodell. You have a tough couple weeks trying to explain what tonight was.

That ref could have thrown a flag, but he didn't, clearly he didn't feel threatened. You can see he wasn't even looking at the ref, it was simply a body grabbing him, so he pushed it away.

It makes the game feel like pro wrestling instead of a genuine competition.  No tinfoil hats here, but something needs to be done if we really want a game played by the rules.

My first thought: on-field refs become basically symbolic.  They're there as figureheads to call obvious penalties and give spectators something to focus on.  The real officiating happens from a team of people watching video feed from all angles.  They tell the on-field refs when to pull flags when the field refs fail.

Flacco, on the other hand, has just won the Super Bowl and has yet to *not* make the playoffs in a season in his career. So he apparently has the consistency that Eli Manning lacks.

Also, the refs were incredibly lenient with PI and illegal contact calls throughout the game. They only called it once in the entire game, when there were a few that could have been called. In the first half, Flacco threw a deep pass to the endzone for Torrey Smith. A Niners DB held him back and clearly could have been penalized for illegal contact, but the refs didn't throw the flag. I'm sure I can dig up other awful no-calls/calls for the Ravens in this game, too. It went both ways.

Also, a holding on the safety probably wouldn't have mattered. I don't think time gets added to the clock in that situation, so the clock would still have run down and the safety would still have been awarded.

It's frustrating to me that even though going for a 4th and 1 is almost always the call that gives your team a better chance to win, a coach is seen as a huge risk taker if he does it.

Taking the safety there was a far safer play, and ran more clock, than risking a blocked punt/punt return/shanked punt...it was far and away the safe call, but you're right, most coaches would never do it because no one else does and they all seem to be bad at their job when it comes to knowing what is actually a risky decision.",1359951548.0,4.0,,Football,3,N

"As a neutral I have to disagree. 

-Lots of non-called offside in the 4th, mostly from the Ravens. 

-The out of bounds hit on Flaco should have been called (the Ravens took a penalty on a much more marginal hit on Kaepernick). 

-Why can't the NFL accurately spot the damn ball? It's insane that Jim Harbaugh had to challenge that first down call when it was obvious the first time round that the Ravens were short. 

-The non PI call at the end. This one isn't really game specific and would have been controversial either way because the league just doesn't seem to have a consistent policy on what constitutes pass interference. Which is a bit of a problem when one of the most important plays in the biggest game of the year cannot be understood by fans, coaches, commentators or the players themselves. The scoring system in Olympic boxing is more transparent. Hell, why not just spin a big wheel after every passing play?
