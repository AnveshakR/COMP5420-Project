RPO RPO RPO RPO RPO RPO RPO what is a catch. Honestly I don't think he and Michaels even know the rule, its so frustrating. 

First one was a catch. He had control and took two steps. The ball didn't start to come out either, looked like he moved it. 

Two, he quite fucking clearly broke the plane then the ground jarred the ball loose. That's a TD all day long I don't even know how that one was a question.

The Patriots are on a plane back to Massachusetts. Belichick is sitting in the front, brooding. Brady timidly approaches. Belichick is stone cold silent.

Belichick shakes his head. Not then. Not there. He needs to be by himself. He needs to regroup. 

Brady presses on, ""I need a hug.""

""Hugs are for winners, Tom.""

""But I *am* a winner,"" Brady pleads. ""I won five Super Bowls.""

""But you didn't win six."" Belichick turns to look at him. ""And you know what happens to people who don't win.""

""They get traded to- GAK!""

Belichick raises his hand, and Brady's breathing constricts. He grabs at his throat as his feet leave the ground.

""GAHCKAAAAAAGGHHHHHHAAAAAHHHHHHHHACH-- *Please*, Daddy, noAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!""

Belichick tightens his grip. Brady turns blue in the face, breathlessly pleads for mercy. Finally, Belichick drops his hand and Brady drops to the floor, gasping for breath.

I never used ""we"" or ""us"" when talking Philly football, but I'm struggling with it tonight. We're used to winning, a lot, until it counts. We're used to getting to the very end and then watching everything fall apart. NFC championship time and time again only to lose it. One Superbowl, came up short. This year, Sproles went down. Peters went down. Hicks went down. Three of our best players, and it felt like more of the same. Wentz went down. That's what we're used to. Already looking forward to next year. Atlanta. Minnesota. Underdogs in both of those games. Towards the end of the game tonight I thought ""Brady is going to get it with 2 minutes left and then that's it."" I was already preparing for the disappointment. ""Well we lost our 4 best players and still got here. Next year will be great."" 2:21 and Brady gets the ball back. This is it. That's the greatest football player to ever step foot on the field. It's over. We're used to this in Philadelphia. Winning until it counts. Then, something different happened. Brady dropped back, and the D line, that hadn't registered a sack all day, got to Brady and forced the ball out. This was a different feeling. Philadelphia. The birthplace of freedom, and where hope dies in December every year. Tonight, Philadelphia has a new identity. They won the big game. Not against just anybody.

Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's Commissioner of the NFL. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Gisele to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero.

If I had told you prior to the game that that Patriots would score 33 points and have 613 yards - and that Brady threw for 505 yards for 3TDS and 0 INTS against that Eagles defense you'd have thought the Pats won. Yet it all amounted to nothing but a big ole' L because the defense couldn't make a single damn play and allowed the Eagles to march down the field possession after possession.

"Not gonna lie. I felt that sack like I was approaching depression. But still, I'm not going to be salty and take shots at the defense or anyone. It is still an incredible game, one of the best SBs of all time. I was at the edge all game.

A big congratulations to Nick Foles, who would've predicted this? If someone told me Nick Foles will win SB MVP I would laugh my ass out. But that game was phenomenal even though it hurts. A back and forth game and thrilling from start to finish. And A BIG CONGRATULATIONS to Philly for winning their first Super Bowl ever.

I'm mad at Twitter trolls though, they will still find ways to flame Brady for this loss. The man had 505 yards and 3 TDs, he did everything that he can do.

"Thought for sure Philadelphia screwed up the time management on the td drive before brady’s Fumble.

Aghelor didn’t stay in bounds on the sideline. Then, they threw an incomplete pass. Could have definitely on those two plays caused the pats to burn their final time out and go through the 2:00 warning... and then they scored the TD. 

Too much time left, I figured.

And then, to borrow an old celtics classic moment, Brandon Graham stole the ball!!! Brandon graham stole the ball!!!!

Still thought they left Brady too much time but that stupid lateral cost then 15 Yds and hogan just missed that big pass on the first play of the drive.

And finally, finally, somebody beats the pats in these close games!!! 

5-3 is Brady/belicheck. Could easily be 3-5, 4-4, or 8-0. I think 5-3 is pretty much what their record should be since they have never blown anyone out. And this time, philly had a qb that didn’t vomit on the field...

The prop is O/U 30.5 YAC. Because he had the TD and the sticks catches, I feel like it has to be way under, but I need to be thorough. Thanks! ",1517842174.0,10,:Eagles: Eagles
