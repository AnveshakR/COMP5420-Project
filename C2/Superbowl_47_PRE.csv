1. Of the total commercials in the first half of play, which will be represented more; beer or cars? 5 years ago, this was an even split…4 to 4, then 2 years of 5-3 for cars…2 years ago 11-3 in favor of cars, and last year cars big again.  So, we set a line. **Choose one:  Cars – 3.5 over Beer.**

2. Predict the total verbal or image references during the game for an all new episode of ELEMENTARY, coming up on CBS right after the game. This includes commercials. **The over/under is 6 and ½.**

3. Predict the total verbal or image references during the game for the CBS Monday night comedy lineup (any reference to HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, 2 BROKE GIRLS, MIKE AND MOLLY, RULES OF ENGAGEMENT) Same rules as above. A commercial referencing more than 1 of the shows still counts as just 1. **The over/under is 7 and 1/2.**

4. Predict the total number of camera shots of Proud Papa Jack Harbaugh, in his seat or box during the game.  **The over/under is 3 and ½.**

5. Predict the total number of pictures or videos showing young Jim and John Harbaugh.  **The over/under is 1 and 1/2.**

6. Any mention of the word “Pistol,” or reference to the “Pistol formation,” by Phil Simms, Jim Nantz, Steve Tasker, or Solomon Wilcots.  **The over/under is 6 and ½.**

7.  Predict how many times annoying rube Phil Simms will admit he was wrong about something.  This includes past documented instances like “my bad,” “I don’t know what I was thinking,” “check that,” and “forget it,” or other new and thrilling examples.   **The over/under is 1 and 1/2.**

8. . Still images or video of Ray Lewis as a younger Baltimore Raven.  This could be a shot of him in Super Bowl, XXXV, or perhaps his first career sack, of Colts QB Jim Harbaugh.    **he over/under is 1 and 1/2.**

9.  Total number of verbal or image references to either former 49’er QBs Joe Montana or Steve Young.  “Young Colin Kaepernick is in some good company…”  **The over/under is 1 and ½.**

10. Name 3 former super bowl winning coaches who will be mentioned by name.
