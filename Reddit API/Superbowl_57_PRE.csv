"GF & me are watching the whole thing through NFL gamepass all the way out in Europe and to be honest I am a little jealous of you guys. Because from what I can tell there are no excessive security measures, there doesn't seem to be a massively enforced split of the fans to avoid any skirmish. Overall people are really out there to have fun, no matter what team you root for.

See, if there's a high-profile ~~football~~ *soccer* match over here in the Netherlands (say... Ajax vs. Feyenoord) then you should expect trouble. Fans are kept separated by police, fans don't get to enter the arena at the same locations and basically the whole area is on edge.

Seems *completely* different over there. That NFL live show with fans from both teams just standing around and having fun?  I'd deem that completely impossible over here.

So yah... I am a bit jealous ;)   What an awesome event!",1676236515.0,6,:Panthers: Panthers

"Maybe a hot take, but I want Fox to completely revamp their pregame team. CBS’s studio team (aside from Simms but better marginalized there than central focus in the booth) is still the gold standard. But Fox’s is becoming aggressively bad. TNF has leap frogged it. It is only better than ESPN and talk about being damned by faint praise. The game has just passed 3 of the 5 by and, unfortunately, those three are the central figures and it is just them trying to out whacky each other. I want football analysts to actually talk about football rather than seeing Terry Bradshaw try to be funny.
