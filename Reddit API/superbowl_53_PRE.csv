I‚Äôm rooting for the Rams, for sure. I just worry they‚Äôre going to try and lay it all out in the first half and get gassed by the 4th where Brady Shines at finishing strong.

I've watched him a fair bit this season - he's looked monstrous at times, and pretty terrible at times.

"this is suppose to be the 8th super bowl rematch 

Today's game between the Rams and Patriots marks the eighth rematch in Super Bowl history.

Good news for the Patriots: The team that won the previous matchup is 4-3. New England defeated the Rams, then in St. Louis, 20-17 back in 2002.

Pittsburgh and Dallas have met three times. Pittsburgh won the first rematch, a 35-31 thriller in Super Bowl 13. Then, 17 years later, Dallas defeated the Steelers 27-17.

Other rematches:

-Redskins 27, Dolphins 17 in Super Bowl 17; a rematch of Miami's perfection-capping victory in Super Bowl 7.

-Giants 21, Patriots 17 in Super Bowl 46; a rematch of New York's win, which spoiled New England's run at an undefeated season, four years earlier.

-Cowboys 30, Bills 13 in Super Bowl 38; a rematch of Dallas' crushing of the Bills the previous year.

-Eagles 41, Patriots 33 in Super Bowl 52; a rematch of New England's win in Super Bowl 39.
