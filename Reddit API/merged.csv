 Joe Mixon will average a measly 2.8 yards per rush attempt and have 3 touchdowns, while Cam Akers will average 4.9 with 1 touchdown. Joe Burrow will have around 70 rushing yards.   


The Bengals will convert a 4th and 4 via a fake punt on their own 26 right before halftime. There will be four 2-pt conversion attempts, only one of which is successful. The score will be 22-13 Rams, going into the fourth quarter.  


 In the fourth quarter, Joe Burrow will throw the pick-6, but the Bengals will score two more tds, and the rams one more after that to make the score 35-26. The Bengals will then attempt an onside kick and recover the ball after a Rams player fumbles. The Bengals score a TD (35-33) and try another onside kick. Unfortunately, it will be unsuccessful, and the Rams will run out the clock with three straight kneels.

I don't particularly care for (but also don't dislike) the Rams, but feel extremely vindicated about Stafford. The NFCN always knew he was a threat but a lot of fans outside the division thought he sucked because the Lions Lion all the time. Also cool to see the OBJ redemption arc.

Outside of this evening, I would say it has been definitely a good year for football. There are things we should still demand more of, including better refereeing/higher standards of refs, reassessment on OT rules, and overall change in certain rules that are ridiculous (""taunting"",  lightly grazing the QBs arm and getting a RTP), but for our first year back to ""normalcy"", this was a very successful year.",1644822562.0,12,:Cowboys: Cowboys,4

Congratulations to Stafford and all the other Rams players on their win. They played better defensively and drove the ball when it mattered. Cincinnati just couldn’t get it done between poor O line play, bad play calls at crucial times and crucial drive ending drops. I thought the Rams were the better team today even though the Bengals kept it close and had an opportunity to win. 

Reffing was still awful. I think the no call OPI to start the second half was just a genuine miss. Impossible to speculate on how the game goes if that is called so it’s not worth the time. However, the refs were allowing some contact all game even in the red zone and end zone without throwing flags.

1 - Great game overall, it was enjoyable.

2 - The Bengals easily could’ve won if they didn’t try to get tricky running shotgun on 4th and 1, or if they handed off to Mixon on 3rd and 1.

3 - Then again, the Bengals never should’ve had that one touchdown, because of the absolutely blatant face mask

5 - This whole “home team winning the super bowl” thing hopefully won’t become a trend, it feels oddly unfair.

6 - Cincinnati needs to hire an entire ass offensive line this off season; they were somehow worse than Pittsburgh

7 - Last one for the conspiracy theory crowd who thinks the NFL is rigged; The key art of the game was Aaron Donald and Joe Burrow, not Matthew Stafford and Joe Burrow… and look how the game ended with Aaron Donald sacking Joe Burrow.

7936,"Zac Taylor’s play calling cost his team the super bowl. 

The pass rush was insane from the front line of the Rams and he kept calling medium to long passing routes and going 4-5 wide out. Pass after pass in a game where he had the lead. Although his offense is usually dynamic, that o line could not hold against the creative pass rush from the Rams, aided by their all star hall of fame talent. Burrow was clobbered. They failed to adjust to run the ball & switch to short passes to move the chains until it was too late. 

It’s a pity, because the Bengals looked like they had it but those missteps opened the window just enough for Matt Stafford, one of the most clutch quarterbacks of all time... and Kupp... one of the greatest if not the greatest WR of all time... to snatch victory and their Super Bowl rings along with their place in the history books, when it all looked certain to be slipping away.

Mcvay for as anxious and panicked as he looked on the sideline... he adjusted, adjusted & kept his team fighting. Showing that the scars they gained from the Patriots, weren’t for nothing like with the Falcons... they learned and it made them stronger... and they’ve reached the mountain top. Finally over the hill after betting everything to win. 

It’s bittersweet to see the Amazing story of the Bengals to come to this end, I’ll remember this Super Bowl as them having a chance... but just falling short to a heroic all time effort from Donald, Kupp, and Stafford.",1644808442.0,2,,4

Run game never worked all day for both teams. That's how Rams won by switching to throws to Kupp and Bengals inexplicably removing his double coverage on those final few Kupp plays
