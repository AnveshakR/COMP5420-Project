"‚ÄúAndy Reid mac n cheese‚Äù recipe:

Ingredients

1/4 pound bacon/8 slices 

1 pound elbow pasta

4 cups whole milk

5 tablespoons butter

6 tablespoons flour

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1 1/2 cups grated fontina

1 1/2 cups grated sharp cheddar

3/4 cup grated mozzarella

3/4 cup grated parmesan

3/4 cup gouda

3/4 cup gruyere

1/2 cup Panko bread crumbs

Fresh parsley

Instructions

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a 9x13 inch pan with butter.

Cook pasta according to package.

Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup fontina, 1/2 cup cheddar, 1/4 cup , mozzarella, 1/4 cup parmesan, 1/4 cup gouda, 1/4 cup gruyere and Panko bread crumbs. Set aside to use as topping later.

Cook bacon in a large pot until crisp. Remove to a paper towel lined plate and crumble into pieces when cooled.

Add butter to the bacon grease in the pan and melt over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2-3 minutes to make a roux. 

Add the salt and mustard. While stirring, slowly stream in the milk, whisking constantly while cooking until it thickens (5-7 minutes).

Stir in the remaining cheese (that you haven‚Äôt set aside for the final topping) until melted.

Add the sauce to the pasta and then pour into the pan. Top with the 
Panko/cheese topping mixture and bacon.

Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden brown and bubbly. Let it rest 5-10 minutes before serving. Serve sprinkled with parsley",1580699460.0,12,:Bengals: Bengals
