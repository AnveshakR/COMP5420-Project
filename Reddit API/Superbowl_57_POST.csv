Where was Reddick? Why were the corners looking lost on ever single drop back? Not to mention— how in god’s name do you have basically *two* delay of game calls in the Super Bowl? How do only have 1 tackle for a loss? 

It’s almost unimaginable, especially after watching every single play this season. A failure on almost all accounts, besides Hurts dragging us through the final frame.

The Eagles could have truly put this to bed with just ONE defensive stop in the second half - which they could not manage.  When the pressure was the greatest the Chiefs stepped up on both sides of the ball, and the Eagles did not.  

At the half it felt like the Eagles were going to break this wide open - they felt dominant, especially when Hurts ran the ball.  He was truly awesome on the ground, and made quite a few big time throws for crucial conversions, but as the game went on it felt like Philly tightened from the top down.  The playcalling got too cute, too much reliance on Hurts' arm, which ain't bad but its not his strength, not when you have to chew clock.  

Its a testament to the Chiefs' resilience, their experience, that brought them this Super Bowl win.

— Eagles get a late FG to force OT

— Eagles get a fast FG and KC still has time to try and win/tie on their next possession 

— Eagles get a fast TD and now the Chiefs are on their heels, needing a TD within 45-75 seconds to win (score would be 42-38)

— Eagles get a late/walkoff TD and win with little time for the Chiefs to properly attempt a drive

I say all of that because while the call will be talked about you can't forget the Chiefs torched the Eagles defense in the second half to get to that position. It was absolutely a tale of two halves and that call sucks, but it was still a great game. Hurts played damn good and I wouldn't have been upset if he became the 2nd player ever to get Superbowl MVP on a losing team.

"The problem with reffing continues to be its inconsistency.

If a penalty is a penalty, call that penalty 100% of the time. Force the players to adjust. Holds, PI, offsides, false starts, delay of game - call every single one until the players stop doing it. We saw how defensive backs adjusted their game with the PI rule changes all those years ago. They went from getting called for PI all the time to being the best the NFL has ever seen.

*or*

They need to *only* call the most egregious of penalties. No debate penalties. “That guy got borderline dragged to the turf being held” type of penalties. “That guy was nearly decapitated” penalties.

These “we let them play until we didn’t” penalties absolutely *kill* these games. That was a brutal ending to a great fucking Super Bowl because they suddenly decided they were going to call a different type of game. That is *fucked up*. We are going to be able to go back and rewatch this game and find that same penalty occur and not get called until it was. They need to entirely reevaluate their reffing philosophies. It *cannot* continue to be the middling “sometimes we call it and sometimes we don’t” approach to reffing. Its not working, and its not fair, which is the only reason the refs exist in the first place - to make sure the game is played as fairly as possible.",1676259931.0,4,

What goes around comes around.,1676258583.0,2,:49ers: 49ers
Fucking pathetic. Two straight seasons of the game being essentially determined by a defensive holding call. At least bengals were given a chance to do something about it offensively. I'd be sick if I was an Eagle fan. Fuck it. I'm sick as a Bengal fan just rooting for a classic game.,1676258584.0,2,:Bengals: Bengals

Worst part is that 1:45 left down by 3pts has the birds leaving with rings,1676258588.0,2,
The defense was BAD second half but that unforced fumble by Hurts feels like a 14 point swing. Never know how it plays out but man..,1676258588.0,2,:Eagles: Eagles
"Don’t get me wrong, I don’t like the holding call there, but it wasn’t egregious in a vacuum. If they call that halfway through q3 no one would remember it. Not worse than the 3 separate “we have no idea what a catch is” moments.

Really sad to end that way, but also don’t give up 24 points in 4 possessions in the 2nd half if you want to win a super bowl.

Unfortunate that one of mahomes craziest playoff performances will be overshadowed by this",1676258590.0,2,:Jets: Jets
KC gifted another game at the end. Unbelievable,1676258592.0,2,
"Literally the second time in NFL history a catch was overturned after the next play was run, followed by the most absolute dog shit penalty in super bowl history to let the Chiefs run the clock and seal it up. Absolutely unreal. I came into this game not even giving a shit if they got blown out, as long as it felt like a fair game. This was literally the one way I didn't want them to lose off of absolutely horseshit officiating. Officiating has been absolutely embarrassing all year, so this almost feels like an appropriate conclusion to the season",1676258594.0,2,
"Honestly, I really like the Chiefs. I like Mahomes and I would have preferred to see them win. But that was a really soft, game-altering call that bordered on the ridiculous when pretty much nothing was called all game.

I truly dont know if the outcome would be different if that penalty wouldve not been called. Who knows? Maybe they throw a pick or something.

Sometimes I notice they all run super fast to start the next play and other times they go slow? Sometimes the clock runs after a play, sometimes not?


So they get near the end zone, DONT score, and do a 3-point field goal instead, giving the other team less time to score (since after they score the ball goes back to the other team)? That’s it? Are you allowed to go for a 3-point field goal whenever you want?

Damar Hamlin went down on a clean football play, Ryan Shazier’s career ended on a clean football play, more personal foul flags do not make the game safer. The rules in their current form combined with an oversight system that doesn’t go far enough are putting the refs in a position to be able to change the outcome of a whole game in a matter of seconds. The league should really get together and fix this, it’s not a good look when the refs are talked about almost as much going into the Super Bowl as the two teams actually playing it.

"I’m a diehard Pats fan. I’ve watched highlights from our Super Bowls more times than I care to admit. One play that I’ll always remember is Julian Edelman scoring the go-ahead TD against the Seahawks in 2014 late in the 4th. 

The reason I bring it up is because he very easily could have been called for an offensive PI after he shoved off his defender to get space on that play. Only the refs didn’t call it because it was the last moments of an epic super bowl, and that’s a 50/50 call any given Sunday so thankfully that ref crew opted to let them play. I would have been salty if it happened to my team, but I would have eventually gotten over it.

I would NEVER get over this if I was an Eagles fan. You cannot throw that flag at that point in the game under those circumstances. It’s the most egregious BS call I have seen in 25 years watching the NFL.",1676258992.0,3,:Patriots: Patriots

Philadelphia, for whatever reason, just could not defend Kansas City’s whip routes and that’s a big reason they lost this SB. These were easily the two best teams in football and it showed. 

I’ve heard a lot of flak for the Bradberry call - and while it was the wrong call (and uncatchable to boot although it’s possible JuJu gave up on the route. Not 100% sure.) I don’t think it was necessarily egregious or anything. In real time, if a ref sees a hand on the WR’s hip on an overthrow and a little bit of a jersey pull that looks like a hold. Even still, Philly benefited from a few calls that could have gone either way - namely, the Sanders incompletion as well as a couple of uncalled holding penalties on Chris Jones.

No, the call wasn't the only reason they lost. The defense was awful in the second half, and that fumble was pathetic.

&#x200B;

That said, the penalty call basically ended the game. It took away the Eagles chance to win the game, that they had 'earned' by forcing the field try. If they had had that drive and failed, I would be disappointed for sure, but I wouldn't feel cheated.

I can’t wait for NFL bootlicker Rich Eisen to gaslight his listeners tomorrow when the topic of rigged NFL comes up. Dude literally thinks the belief is that Roger Goodell meets with refs and tells them an ending. NOBODY is saying that’s what it is. Rigging is subtle. If there’s an opportunity where a spread can be beaten and a call can be called is when rigging occurs. Also to act like suggesting a rigged game is blasphemy is absurd considering THERE IS A PRECEDENT. SEE TIM DONAGHY.,1676261244.0,6,:Patriots: Patriots
