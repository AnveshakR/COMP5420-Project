The second half should get even more open with City pressing for an equalizer. Wouldn't be surprised to see Sterling tanked at HT or shortly into the second for Aguero and City getting more direct, and I would bet Pulisic comes in around 55-60 to start running at people and be available for the counters that are sure to come. Gutted for Thiago Silva, was this possibly his final top-flight match? Or is he planning on sticking with Chelsea another season? Fun match to watch, hopefully it stays this way.

Pep going with Gundogan as a defensive midfielder has been a massive issue. They haven’t been able to retrieve the ball early and as a result Chelsea have been able to counter attack, which resulted in the goal.


In addition, Chelsea’s attack has been making very good decisions. Either a good pass forward, or try to keep possession and build slowly if they can’t find a pass. So far the decision making has been tactically spot on.

I think Pep will have to introduce Fernandinho and Jesus. Gundogan or Silva will be off and I think Mahrez or Foden. These decisions will be interesting to keep an eye on.",1622317979.0,14,

The CBs pushing up into midfield and then dropping back when needed is excellent if you have two smart, athletic CBs like Rudiger and Azpillicueta. This could be a new trend now- using CBs that are able to travel up and down the pitch. The three forwards running down the channels fluidly, quick transitions, and lots of running directly at defenders to make them uncomfortable and force them to commit before playing balls into the channels.

It definitely requires certain types of players (lots of athleticism for sure) but it works well.",1622318586.0,11,
