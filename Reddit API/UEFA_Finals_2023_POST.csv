I don't think Lukaku was as bad as people say here, yes he could have done better on the header but immediately improved the team when he came on. Lautaro has a lot of grit but did very little after winning the ball

That hurts... 

Hats off to the lads, to Inzaghi, to everyone. What a campaign we had. We put in a great challenge at the trophy. Manchester City didn't struggle against anyone like they did with us.

I won't lie I only tried to pay attention to the positions/space of the players for around 60'ish minutes before praying for the Lakaka memes to come true. However... 

I thought Inter did fantastic and were one of the few teams this season to give City a real fight.(especially defensively) City interestingly this time went for a back 3 with ONE PIVOT in Rodri. Stones/Gundogan occupied the  LCM/RCM with De Bruyne occupying the CAM position. They probably went with this shape because man to man Inter defended with 2 up top / 3 in the midfield outnumbering the usual double pivot formation City have had this season. 

City defended with 4 uptop and constantly pressured the 3 Inter defenders. However Onana was fantastic and was amazing at his feet. Constantly finding long balls to distribute away from that press/find the Wingbacks. Lukaku especially was amazing at receiving long balls to cushion for his teammates, creating chance after chance. (Don't ever let anybody say Lukaku played bad this game, he was phenomenal and created chaos in the City back line) Just unlucky in the end. 

MVP should go to Ederson just for keeping City alive in the end lol. City were a fun team to watch this season, and looking at it from a pure footballing perspective deserved this UCL. Pep finally found the solutions to his problems, constantly tinkering and experimenting. Whether its anything in life that type of forward thinking will yield you something new. New tactics for attacking/ defending.... exploiting specific areas of the field... finding overloads, etc. It's why he is one of the greatest managers in football.",1686460552.0,3,

So when teams don‚Äôt mark Haaland, he scores. When they don‚Äôt double team Bernardo/Mahrez or Grealish/Foden they create or score. And if they don‚Äôt close down the edge of the box in front of goal, then KDB/Rodri/Gundo score. 

It‚Äôs a bit of a fluke goal, but it‚Äôs part of their system. Gundo scored 2 from there in the FA cup. Rodri and KDB scored against Bayern/Real Madrid from there. It‚Äôs a fluke, but it‚Äôs not.",1686438157.0,7,
"
> City's goal came from the one moment in the game where there was no Inter player to immediately close down the City player.

That's just what you can do when you have some of the very best midfielders in the sport. Rodri, Gundogan, Bernardo, De Bruyne, they can all take that shot and they need only one chance (Gundogan Vs Man Utd got two...). Even Stones is starting to take those shots - not well yet, but who knows. And then these guys rotate positions with the likes of Foden, Grealish, and Mahrez - keeping all of them starved of space is a very hard job.

I think Old Pep has started to embrace the idea that not everything can be set up as a tactic, not every game is won on the whiteboard - you need a solid plan and a good idea of how players should link up, but there is something that you cannot predict, something for which you just need great players. 10 years ago he wouldn't have bought a Haaland, maybe not even 5 years ago...
