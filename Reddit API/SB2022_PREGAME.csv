"My NFL 96 game predicts that the Rams will win 35-33.   
Joe Burrow will throw 3 ints including a pick-6 and 2 touchdowns. Matt Stafford will throw 1 pick and 4 touchdowns. Joe Burrow will be sacked 5 times, while Matt Stafford will never be sacked.  
 Joe Mixon will average a measly 2.8 yards per rush attempt and have 3 touchdowns, while Cam Akers will average 4.9 with 1 touchdown. Joe Burrow will have around 70 rushing yards.   


The Bengals will convert a 4th and 4 via a fake punt on their own 26 right before halftime. There will be four 2-pt conversion attempts, only one of which is successful. The score will be 22-13 Rams, going into the fourth quarter.  


 In the fourth quarter, Joe Burrow will throw the pick-6, but the Bengals will score two more tds, and the rams one more after that to make the score 35-26. The Bengals will then attempt an onside kick and recover the ball after a Rams player fumbles. The Bengals score a TD (35-33) and try another onside kick. Unfortunately, it will be unsuccessful, and the Rams will run out the clock with three straight kneels. The Rams win their second Lombardy, and the Bengals suffer a close defeat.",1644792978.0,4
