"Sometimes finals are cagey. Nerves and pressure play a big part. I think both teams know each other very well and both teams are dangerous. The early goal made things difficult for Liverpool as they wanted to protect the lead. Trent and Robertson played more like full backs than the attacking wingback they are. 

Spurs were really poor in the final third. Eriksen was anonymous and Dele wasteful. Kane needs service as he's a striker and these two didn't provide anything. Son worked hard but his technique let him down, which is unusual. Moura didn't add anything really and missed two good chances. 

Both defences played well though and I think this also had an impact on the lower tempo. It was a shame the game didn't flow, but it tends to be the case in finals with teams from the same Country.

I'm a Spurs fan, but Liverpool have been excellent this season and deserved a trophy. Im gutted it was at our expense. I'm interested to see what transfers we make this summer, but I'd like to see an alternative to Dele or a system without him.",1559424794.0,11,:r_soccer_user:

You have to think that Lucas is just a more useful player than Kane in this game. Spurs desperately need to create chances on the counter and Kane doesn't seem to be at 100% with his movement. I'm sure he's plenty capable of finishing like usual but there might not even be a chance for him given the current game conditions.

Kane is useless because Matip and VVD are double-teaming him, Winks and Sissoko have no hope of pass through this Liverpool midfield on their own when Alli and Eriksen are so far up the field. Their only outlets are long balls or broken plays.

Winks dropping between the two CBs so the CBs arent out-numbered by Liverpools front 3 when building up, and Eriksen dropping further back would help them build properly",1559417848.0,4,

Unfortunately the early goal made Liverpool want to play much safer so they're not punishing as much as they could, playing a ton of long balls.

Lucas with a little luck could make an instant impact if they keep their strategy, Tottenham had some good moments with quick passing between Alli and Eriksen and they could use someone else to not depend on Son dribbling today.

Handling the ball involves a deliberate act of a player making contact with the ball with the hand or arm.

The following must be considered:
• the movement of the hand towards the ball (not the ball towards the hand) 
• the distance between the opponent and the ball (unexpected ball)
• the position of the hand does not necessarily mean that there is an offence
