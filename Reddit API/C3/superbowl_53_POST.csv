They held the 12th highest scoring offense in NFL history to 3 points in the Super Bowl.

The Pats found a way to get pressure rushing stock, blitz, you name it, and disrupt the run even without over-committing. 

The Rams offense chooses to be at a numbers disadvantage in the run game, and it finally bit them in the ass. 

McVay is a phenomenal coach, young or old, but next year he -has- to learn to adapt his offense outside of the 11 personnel. I don't care how varied your playbook is in that set.

" For those haters (kinda sad tbh, though I know not everyone here is one) here are some stats, since you guys seem to like those.

Super Bowl records Brady owns:

Most games played, Most wins, Most passing touchdowns, Most passing yards overall, Most passing yards in a game, Oldest quarterback, Most 300-yard passing games (Brady has thrown for at least 300 yards four times Super Bowls XXXVIII, XLIX, LI, LII), Most passes without an interception, Most pass completions overall, Most pass completions in a game. 

These are only Super Bowl stats... there are so many others it's actually kind of ridiculous. Just a few other stats, to put things into perspective for some haters (though they will probably never stop hating, people hate on greatness).

Brady has nine postseason comebacks in the fourth quarter, which is the most in NFL history. To put that into perspective, John Elway and Joe Montana have nine fourth-quarter playoff comebacks combined. FURTHERMORE, Brady's contemporaries, Drew Brees, Peyton Manning, and Aaron Rodgers, only have five such comebacks between them. FIVE BETWEEN THEM. 

Oh and Tom Brady also has 6 super bowl rings... more than... any other player... ever. Since the stats obviously weren't enough (lol). ",1549260716.0,6,

"To expand on the post-game media scrum last night:

For context, this was the scene [immediately following Super Bowl IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANGtrH8UGuM). These relatively subdued, locker room celebrations were the norm into [the mid-1990s.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvUqP0ZXehA) No on-field podiums, no on-field interviews, there's isn't even confetti. 

I cannot emphasize this enough:  If the public didn't hold this insatiable demand for soundbites and photos following sporting events, especially championship games, this wouldn't have happened. If the NFL didn't want all those people on the field after the game, they wouldn't have been there.

I mean think about it: unless you're from a newspaper or TV/Radio station from one of the participant's respective markets or a wire service or a national network, why on Earth would you send any of your personnel to this game? Don't you know how expensive it is to get just one writer and photographer out to the Super Bowl? Thousands of dollars that could be spent (perhaps more effectively) elsewhere. And that's just from the American press. There's a whole array of international reporters and photographers at the game. Do you really think the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/47112047) would send anyone to America for this game if there wasn't enough demand for it?

You can get on your moral high horse from now until kingdom come but it doesn't change the fact that those people wouldn't be ruining precious moments and memories for those players, coaches, and trainers (and their families) if the public didn't want it. If they didn't, they wouldn't be there and most of them probably wouldn't want to be there since sports desk deadlines are often the latest and most grueling to meet.",1549296083.0,5,:Commanders: Commanders

Against the Patriots on this stage, you can't play it safe and call a regular football game hoping to win a tight one by out scheming Belichick.

4. Do not allow Bill Belichick to sign any white offensive skill players, otherwise they will become pro bowlers. ESPECIALLY THE UNDRAFTED ONES

Hopefully this serves as a much needed learning experience for our inexperienced QB who definitely looked out of place on that field today, I don't care what any homer wants to say.

"I don't give a fuck. Brady one of the best American athletes ever. He didn't play great, but guy made the plays when it mattered. But its crazy people hate the Pats but love the 90s Bulls.

I’m glad they chose the tiniest woman for the camera and reporter mosh pit.,1549249822.0,3,
I love how during the season it was the defense that was mediocre but the offense was good. During the postseason the defense stepped up but the offense disappeared. The defense played great this game. While I am glad the Rams made the sb I feel like the saints would've made it more interesting and possibly could've won it,1549249826.0,3,:Rams: Rams
