First up, congratulations to Liverpool. You scored the goals, you deserved it. I'm still not sure about the penalty, but I would have to have another look.

Apart from that, I'd say both teams looked kind of lackluster. Not sure why that was. I personally think starting Kane was a mistake.

I'm sad, sure, but not quite as upset as I thought I'd be. I guess because I feel the future is still bright, as long as things don't fall apart now.

End of the day, the season as a whole was quite poor yet we still finished in the top four and got to a European final. Given I know the team has a higher ceiling, that's progress. Now it's down to Levy to show Poch it's worth sticking with us by making some serious investment in the squad.

That's the end of football for me until August as I generally don't care about international football (apart from liking good matches). See you all then.

1. This was Madrid? It sounded like freaking Anfield and the Kop End.
2. The very moment the final whistle is blown, Migs sprinted across the field straight into Ali - imagine the class of that, since he was left out in last year's finals, and again this year.
3. Ali gets most of the kudos for the match, but look at Trent's tackles at Son and Ali when he was last man + how he avoided making rash challenges that would get him easily passed + the way he sprinted in celebration in the second goal was so Gerrard-esque!!!
4. If Son didn't have to worry about mandatory military enlistment (before the exemption), he would probably be in one of the big boys teams now - what a player, such silky runs, would have been a phenomenal Klopp player with his passion and workrate.
5. Everyone's comments on the boring match is a testament to our defence more than anything, in my opinion. Matip has been a solid rock even though the spotlight is (rightly) on Virg.

"First off that was not a penalty. If they give that they'll have to be giving multiple pens every match. Simply awful reffing there. The rules need to change cuz right they're ridiculous, a nonsense and are actively ruining the spectacle. Certainly tonight that shit ref call changed the match and handed Liverpool the win essentially. It changed the match.

Secondly regarding Spurs: Kane was not in any way match fit. He should not of started. Poch made a mistake there. I mean playing a player whose been out for 2 months and his first game back is the Champions League final etc.. It was madness. Kane was never gone be on it 100%. Moura really shouldve started. Certainly he wouldve provided more of a threat with his pace, directness and runs in behind etc.. Alas Spurs had no cutting edge and were waay too slow. I also thought Eriksen was really bad tonight, totally anon, and dare i say it but imo Eriksen put in a very Ozil peformance, he was awful. Likewise Delo Ali was utter rubbish too(as he has been all season). I also think Poch waited too long to make subs.


Lastly i dont think Liverpool were very good either. All they did was long ball-counter attcking football, it was really not like Livdrpool. I still think Spurs couldve and shouldve won the game. I mean Spurs were totally bossing the 2nd half, they were all over Liverpool, but just couldnt make it happen. Liverpool were there for the taking.

"Completely agree. When Spurs played Liverpool at Anfield Moura was so dangerous with his pace and was a real threat whenever he got on the ball. Kane is a brilliant striker no doubt about that, but he should've been subbed because the system wasn't working.

Firmino was one one of Liverpool's best players this season but he barely showed in the final and Klopp subbed him fairly early. As much as Kane deserves to be there, playing him was the wrong decision. Moura would've been a lot more of a problem for Liverpool's defence.

Maybe a bit of sentimentality from Pochettino that has backfired but hopefully he will learn from it and Spurs can go again next season. They've been great to watch this year and with a few signings in the summer they should be challenging much closer to Liverpool and City which is only good for the league.

"Absolutely. Whilst Kane and Winks were injured our team was forced to come together as a cohesive unit, and we achieved better results than with them.     
 
Moura is not a better player than Kane on paper. But as a component of this squad he gets a hat-trick vs Ajax and is instrumental to us getting to the final.

Can't really make a call on right or wrong tactics. When they get a penalty one minute in it changes the complexion of the game completely. From there Liverpool can focus on defending so of course Kane is going to find the game more difficult.,1559442286.0,5,:Tottenham_Hotspur:

Yes you‚Äôve beaten us to the league twice in the last 5 years, but in that time we‚Äôve been to the CL final twice (((winning one))). The final of the only competition your owners care about. 

You‚Äôve choked away quarterfinals to English clubs two years in a row(because you‚Äôre a joke of a club) and that‚Äôs most likely the best you‚Äôll ever do. Supporters in England want you to win the league because you‚Äôre viewed as an absolute nothing of a club.

That doesn't make someone CLEARLY the best GK nor the best defender. You could argue that they were those within the PL and that VVD deservedly won best player. However, both Ederson and Laporte are in the PL team of the year for a reason. They also enter that discussion.

That's just the PL though. The moment you go abroad, there are even more players who enter that discussion. I think it's certainly fair to say that both VVD and Allison are contenders when it comes to best players in their respective positions **this season**.

A progressively and rising club, seen by improvements in performance gradually over the recent string of seasons.

It took Man City winning the league to establish themselves as a big club, not them winning the FA Cup beforehand.

Hell, even reaching the Champions League final itself is a bigger accomplishment than winning a domestic cup because it requires playing the best clubs in Europe instead of 3rd and 4th tier clubs.

Why do you minimize my points on Stan Kroenke? Is there something about Stan Kroenke that is displeasing to you? Please tell me what about Stan Kroenke is not warming",1559506541.0,1,:Tottenham_Hotspur:
Maybe you just dont like football? Has that thought crossed your mind? Football is the biggest sport in the world. Most fans. You saying all those go to matches to watch something boring?,1559424821.0,6,:England:
"No, I initially said u have 0 PREMIER LEAGUE titles. To which u replied u have 18. U were wrong about that . Don't waste my fucking time

Premier league and league titles are different. Do u want me to make it clearer still?",1559430181.0,-4,

"Everyone knows Kronke is a bad owner, what do you want me to do? Defend him blindly? If anything, why‚Äôre you so obsessed with him. You‚Äôve brung him up in everyone of your replies. 

And in response to being a rising club, are arsenal not also doing that? The difference is that arsenal have already achieved the highs of winning the league. Which is why we are an infinitely better club. Which was what my original point was about when I said you wouldn‚Äôt understand. I don‚Äôt know why you are obsessively trying to turn this into an argument about kronke",1559506948.0,1,:Arsenal:
"Are you not listening on purpose? The Majority of football matches are boring. You could give me 10 highly entertaining, high scoring matches and I could give you 50 boring matches. 

I‚Äôm not saying football is boring, far from it, but with the way the game has developed and how teams have gotten so scared to concede, it‚Äôs become boring.",1559424903.0,-4,

Actually you are wrong. There are more goals scored these days. The trend has gone towards more goals over the years. https://www.statista.com/statistics/269029/number-of-goals-scored-at-fifa-world-cups-since-1930/,1559425382.0,6,:England:

History is irrelevant . City have a better future and better present. Keep clinging on to titles u won a hundred years ago if it makes you feel better about being a mid table club for the past ten years",1559430415.0,-4,

2. This is the World Cup, a once every 4 years event.

"You said that games were boring because teams are scared to concede, implying that teams dont concede as many goals. I then proved that you were factually wrong. It also applys to other tournaments then the WC btw so theres that. Goals scored doesnt necessarily equal a better game, I agree. However you brought that up as an argument? So what is your argument? Are you saying that football players are objectively worse at the game these days, which is wrong btw. I really dont see what you are trying to say. More goals scored in the modern game. Higher intensity, better technique and better players. 

I think you are just an American tbh.",1559426217.0,6,:England:

"How many games were Man United (a team that consistently sold out their 75,000 ticket allocation every home game) genuinely exciting to watch this season? 

I‚Äôm not American. 

I‚Äôm talking more about the slow build more than anything, also the fact teams time waste with 20 minutes to go, and the fact whenever a lower positioned team plays a top side, they sit back for 90 minutes playing for the 0-0 (which is my main point for teams being scared to concede.)
