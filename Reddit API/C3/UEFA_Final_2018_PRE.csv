Liverpool was great in the first 25 mibs, pressing and attacking non-stop, not giving any space to Real.

Klopp needs to apply a new tactic to keep the pressure on Madrid, as Liverpool is dead if they try to only defend from now on. As a neutral, I hope he can surprise Madrid and make this game as exciting as it was before Salah's unfortunate / infuriating exit.

Man i'm so over Toni Kroos standing like a statue when he doesn't have the ball. He struggles to make space for the CB's when they're under pressure on the ball and luka is the only one that seems to do it. One of the most frustrating things to watch and nobody ever calls him out for it. He's so fucking lazy at times,1527363928.0,7,
"To all who are saying lallana will score the winner.....

u right",1527363930.0,5,:Liverpool:
"Liverpool started the half terrifically, their press really unsettled Madrid. The front three all did their jobs well but the battle at that point was really won in midfield. The three Liverpool midfielders worked so hard to cut off the passing lanes and that meant Real just couldn't play out through their 4 central midfielders, having to resort to long balls or trying to move up the pitch through the wings. The injury was not only costly because they lost Salah but it also disrupted the press. It only takes 1 or 2 players to be slightly out of position for it to start to fall apart and that's what's started to happen, Kroos, Modric and Isco have been able to get on the ball in central areas far more, if that continues in the 2nd half Liverpool will be in big trouble imo.",1527363969.0,8,:England:
"From Liverpool side, TAA has been amazing. Firmino was pretty dangerous early on too. Too bad he didn't get many chances near the end of this half.

RM has been depending mostly on their defenders to clear and then Kroos passes to Modric who then plays amazingly to pass the balll to Nacho and then the effort is defended well by LP.

Enjoying this game, but I wish Mo and Carvahal wouldn't have been injured.",1527363990.0,8,
