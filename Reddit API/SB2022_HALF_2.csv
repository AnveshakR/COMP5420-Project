In the 44 seasons before the Fords, the franchise had 20 winning seasons and won 4 NFL Championships. In the 58 full seasons of Ford ownership, they've had 15 winning seasons - with 1 (one) playoff victory. They were minority owners 1960-63, and bought the team outright at 11am on November 22, 1963 - 90 minutes before JFK was assassinated.

The overall first pick of the 2009 had a playoff record of 0-3 in Detroit, and ends year one After Detroit at 4-3. Sheila Ford Hamp may be different than her mum or dad. As of right now, she is 8-24-1 as Chairperson, and Matthew Stafford is a World Champion.

"The year is 2048 and the Food Network finally shuts its doors and sells the channel, this puts everyone working at the network at this time out of a job. As we follow the last remaining worker onto his deathbed, he is surrounded by his family and friends. He knows his hours are numbered but he has to eat at one more restaurant.
He dusts off his red convertible and drives off far away, frosting his remaining hair as he drives. Once he arrives at the restaurant he orders the largest juiciest burger on the menu. Once he receives his sandwich he reflects for a minute, thinking back to the forty seasons of his show and how every single meal was a blessing.
He bites down on his burger and his heart stops.
After he awakens in a bright white location, squinting his eyes he sees him. God himself with the same frosted tips as the man does. When the man asks “Where am I” the lord replied swiftly.
