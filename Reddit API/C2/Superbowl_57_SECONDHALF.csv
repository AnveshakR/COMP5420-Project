"The Eagles defense utterly sucked but Hurts being robbed of a chance to go down and win the game because of a soft ass holding call will hang over this one. Was an all time great Super Bowl and to have the refs interfere like that- like maybe the Chiefs still win! I didnt really care who won, was rooting for KC if anything, but man I feel bad for Hurts not even getting a chance. Should have been 38-35 KC with like 1:40 and 1 timeout for Hurts to have his shot. 

And conspiracy wise it doesnt make sense either- NFL would rather rather have Hurts have a shot to go down and score and add more drama to the end. This was just incompetent reffing. There is no way you call that hold in that situation, it would have been a ticky tack holding call regardless of the situation but just to hand the Chiefs the game like that just makes it more godawful. Only people who liked that ending are Chiefs fans and NFCE fans that aren't Eagles and maybe not all of them.
