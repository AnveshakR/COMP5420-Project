Not a lot of threat on goal but the tactical battle in midfield has been super interesting as City try to work space and Inter try to jump on mistakes with lots of pressure from multiple players at once.

De Bruyne going off is a problem because as good as Foden is, he doesn't have that same ability that de Bruyne has to drop out of the midfield to find a bit of space.

I think both managers will be pretty happy and the instructions will be to stay calm and stick to the plan.",1686426736.0,23,:Manchester_United:

Inter have kept their shape excellently, every defender when they can leaving 5 yards clear in front of themselves to give time and space to watch what City players are doing. Their forwards know what their role is, even dropping back when City's possession lasts longer than a few passes.

This causes City problems because it highlights their lack of pace on the wings. Front and back. Inter's WB's push up because they know Grealish/Bernardo ain't tracking back nor pulling away with speed on a counter.

Haaland is isolated then because he is the only pace City have in the team, and Inter's midfield are shutting that shit down. Can't remember the last time I've seen Gundogan sit so deep.

So, interesting. Pep's the one needing to change something here. Inzaghi will happily do this for the rest of the game.",1686426878.0,13,

"I've got a lot of time for De Bruyne making that call.

It might have been an injury he could have played through, and the call was his to make, but clearly felt that he was limited by an injury. Had to make a judgement on whether he could contribute in the limited capacity but instead trusted his teammates enough, and Foden, to not only get the job done but also deliver a better performance without him there. Also didn't delay the decision and gave them 2/3rds of the game to do so.

Fair play; bigger egos would have played on if given the chance.",1686426140.0,6,:Chelsea_s_Rampant_Lion:
