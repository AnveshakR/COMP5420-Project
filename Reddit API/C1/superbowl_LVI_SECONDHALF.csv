In the 44 seasons before the Fords, the franchise had 20 winning seasons and won 4 NFL Championships. In the 58 full seasons of Ford ownership, they've had 15 winning seasons - with 1 (one) playoff victory. They were minority owners 1960-63, and bought the team outright at 11am on November 22, 1963 - 90 minutes before JFK was assassinated.

The overall first pick of the 2009 had a playoff record of 0-3 in Detroit, and ends year one After Detroit at 4-3. Sheila Ford Hamp may be different than her mum or dad. As of right now, she is 8-24-1 as Chairperson, and Matthew Stafford is a World Champion.
