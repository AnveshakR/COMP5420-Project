A year ago, there was an African American QB who threw the Super Bowl losing INT. And he handled it with grace. He took it like a man. He didn't walk out on the presser.

And of course, the most discussed about play -- When he pusses out of the fumble recovery attempt after thinking about diving in. It's easy to be great and have fun when you're winning all year. Why the hell didn't you dive for that fumble? You were only down 6!!

Got to the Super Bowl and dominated an ill-prepared and ill-equipped Panthers team.

If you don't believe in sports gods, here you go. They were ONE slip up away from going to Cincy and New England in the playoffs, and never once caught the bad end of the stick. A defense can only go so far until you realize that, when you convert that many, it's just destiny.

It's like how I felt for Ray Lewis in Super Bowl XLVII.

However, I also feel like Cam Newton and the Panthers' stellar season effectively means nothing now. I mean, they *did* lose the Super Bowl, which I had hoped would give me more competition than it did. But nothing, I feel, also applies to their reputation, especially Cam Newton's. Before the season started, it seemed that Carolina was stuck in a rut, with Newton just a flashy but mediocre quarterback. With this loss, it seems as though all the games Carolina won to toss away that image of theirs has reformed, and they'll have to start over. I know that Newton will win a Super Bowl. He has both the offense *and* the defense to get there. But it feels like this season did very little to improve their overall standing, what with their loss tonight.",1454902938.0,7,:NFL: NFL

And even though he's great, he may never get back to a Super Bowl.  It's very possible.  In an era where everyone seems to be fake and present a corporate image, Cam just puts it out there.  I respect that.  

As for the game itself, I found it boring.  I like defensive struggles but this was more of a blowout without the scoring.  After that first three and out by the Panthers (yes with a blown call on the challenge) there wasn't any point on the game where I thought Carolina had a chance.

"I'm surprised at how much people were piling on both QBs. Both their picks were their fault. But the fumbles and the ineffective offenses were way more about the offensive lines getting eaten alive by dominant defensive stars. I know the Super Bowl attracts a lot of casual fans, and casual fans like offense. But it's ok to have defensive slugfests too. It's ok for offenses to get carried by their defenses at times, especially when QBs like Manning and Newton have carried their teams to wins so many times before. I thought both QBs played pretty decent considering they were up against two of the best defenses in the league. I thought it was a great game, I'm so happy for Manning, and I think Panthers fans have a long, bright future ahead of them in Cam Newton.

"That Denver defense is incredible. Wade Phillips is incredible. My original prediction was 24-17 Carolina. The closer it got to game time though, the more I thought Denver would win a close one. I changed it to 23-20 Denver. No way would I have predicted a two possession victory though.

A few things:

First, what an incredible come back story for Peyton. I am so happy for him. Not only within this season, but to come back from those surgeries and have a spectacular season and then get another championship. Wow.

Second, Cam's pocket awareness is awful. It always has been, but his athleticism gets him out of it. He will improve this though, and he will be a top QB in this league for a long time. Carolina isn't going anywhere. He and Russell could very well be the next great QB rivalry.

Third, I know 4th and 24 from your own 3 is an extreme long shot. However, you can't punt there. You just can't. There's 2 minutes left and it's a 2 possession game. Punting there is sealing the victory for Denver. That means the best case scenario is you take over around your 20 yard line with 40 seconds left still down 14.
