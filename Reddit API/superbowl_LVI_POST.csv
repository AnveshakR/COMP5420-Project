"May be an unpopular opinion with many, but this was probably one of the best overall Super Bowl evenings in years.

Two teams that no one really expected to get here, both having great players and stories (Joe Burrow/Jamarr Chase bromance, Matthew Stafford's escape from Detroit, etc.), a very close game,  ref involvement wasn't all game (though there were some missed and bad calls), a halftime show that highlighted some huge, influential artists out of the area (and almost entirely rap/R&B, which years ago would have been taboo).

Outside of this evening, I would say it has been definitely a good year for football. There are things we should still demand more of, including better refereeing/higher standards of refs, reassessment on OT rules, and overall change in certain rules that are ridiculous (""taunting"",  lightly grazing the QBs arm and getting a RTP), but for our first year back to ""normalcy"", this was a very successful year.",1644822562.0,12,:Cowboys: Cowboys

They basically rode those 2 plays for as long as they could the rest of the game, but it just wasn't enough. The Rams' defense would not let the game get out of hand. Bengals management needs to get Burrow an O-line like yesterday!

On all those flags in the last 2 minutes, I think the first one was the only bad one, which if that doesn't even get thrown, the other flags might not ever happen since it would have been 4th down and the defense had all the momentum at that point.

In the end it came down to fourth downs.. Rams converted when they needed to and went and scored a touchdown.. Bengals couldn‚Äôt convert in the first half and gave Rams the first touchdown.. 

What an unexpectedly beautiful season though.. Whatever happens next season it won‚Äôt live up to how much this season meant to the city and fans",1644808641.0,9,:Bengals: Bengals

I get it, they were letting them play a little more tough earlier, but you can't just not call obvious game altering fouls at the end of the biggest game of the year. Blame the refs for the holding call (and the missed OPI on the big Higgins TD), but blame Cincy for getting sloppy at the end and grabbing jerseys in the endzone. I'm a Vikings fan so I didn't really have a dog in this race, but I wouldn't really say that game was decided by the refs so much as Cincy's O line disappearing and their DBs getting grabby in the 4th.",1644808790.0,6,

Again, that's no slight at the Bengals, they would not have been here if it was just the Burrow and Chase show, it's more of a compliment to the Rams than anything.

You need a guy capable of competing with the young guns like Burrow, Mahomes, Herbert and Allen, but just as important is the team around him, thus, the lesson to learn is that every great quarterback needs help to succeed.

Everyone is playing so tense and carefully. There is a lot of downtime - many more commercials, longer half time show, hard to get any kind of rhythm going. The Super Bowl has a very artificial feel to it. I find the rest of the playoffs to be much more entertaining.

But I don't want to poop on the parade, it wasn't a bad game or anything, I just think Super Bowls feel a lot different than any other games in the season, but not necessarily in the good way, there's just something unsatisfying about them, when they should be the perfect way to end to a season.",1644838940.0,5,

I feel for the Bengals, but if there is a silver lining, they know what they need to improve. FA, and the draft should primarily be spent improving their offensive line.

Congratulations to Stafford and all the other Rams players on their win. They played better defensively and drove the ball when it mattered. Cincinnati just couldn‚Äôt get it done between poor O line play, bad play calls at crucial times and crucial drive ending drops. I thought the Rams were the better team today even though the Bengals kept it close and had an opportunity to win. 

Reffing was still awful. I think the no call OPI to start the second half was just a genuine miss. Impossible to speculate on how the game goes if that is called so it‚Äôs not worth the time. However, the refs were allowing some contact all game even in the red zone and end zone without throwing flags.

3 - Then again, the Bengals never should‚Äôve had that one touchdown, because of the absolutely blatant face mask

5 - This whole ‚Äúhome team winning the super bowl‚Äù thing hopefully won‚Äôt become a trend, it feels oddly unfair.

6 - Cincinnati needs to hire an entire ass offensive line this off season; they were somehow worse than Pittsburgh

7 - Last one for the conspiracy theory crowd who thinks the NFL is rigged; The key art of the game was Aaron Donald and Joe Burrow, not Matthew Stafford and Joe Burrow‚Ä¶ and look how the game ended with Aaron Donald sacking Joe Burrow.

STAFFORD FINALLY GETS HIS üò≠üôè,1644808432.0,2,:Ravens: Ravens
"Zac Taylor‚Äôs play calling cost his team the super bowl. 

The pass rush was insane from the front line of the Rams and he kept calling medium to long passing routes and going 4-5 wide out. Pass after pass in a game where he had the lead. Although his offense is usually dynamic, that o line could not hold against the creative pass rush from the Rams, aided by their all star hall of fame talent. Burrow was clobbered. They failed to adjust to run the ball & switch to short passes to move the chains until it was too late. 

It‚Äôs a pity, because the Bengals looked like they had it but those missteps opened the window just enough for Matt Stafford, one of the most clutch quarterbacks of all time... and Kupp... one of the greatest if not the greatest WR of all time... to snatch victory and their Super Bowl rings along with their place in the history books, when it all looked certain to be slipping away.

Mcvay for as anxious and panicked as he looked on the sideline... he adjusted, adjusted & kept his team fighting. Showing that the scars they gained from the Patriots, weren‚Äôt for nothing like with the Falcons... they learned and it made them stronger... and they‚Äôve reached the mountain top. Finally over the hill after betting everything to win. 

It‚Äôs bittersweet to see the Amazing story of the Bengals to come to this end, I‚Äôll remember this Super Bowl as them having a chance... but just falling short to a heroic all time effort from Donald, Kupp, and Stafford.",1644808442.0,2,

"What killed Bengals final drive was running the ball on 3rd and 1.

Run game never worked all day for both teams. That's how Rams won by switching to throws to Kupp and Bengals inexplicably removing his double coverage on those final few Kupp plays
