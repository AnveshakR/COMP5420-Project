J-lo's part was a little more difficult to watch. Her singing felt very flat. Not in terms of key necessarily, but it felt like she had to direct a lot more of her attention to the coreograpghy and singing was more of an afterthought and even her dancing was very stiff. Parts of it felt like you could see her trying to remember which part came next and hesitating. And let's be honest, the songs are just not as good. But I'm not gonna dissect j-lo lyrics unless somebody pays me

Still, it wasn't too bad untill they came on stage together and you could see exactly how much more fluid, or comfortable Shakira felt than j-lo

Mahomes is a generational talent who was always going to win at least one and probably a couple before he hangs them up, so he might as well get his first while we are working our way back to contender status as far as I'm concerned. Hoping we can make this division truly competitive sooner than later but with what the Chiefs have on roster for the next two years or so before all their key pieces sign massive contracts, that's going to be a real challenge. 

Some headscratching coaching moments from Shanny and some poor throws in big moments from Jimmy G were a lot of the difference in this game, and Mahomes was not his usual casually dominant self for long stretches of this one (and didn't deserve MVP over Damien Williams IMO but the league was never gonna pass on a Mahomes Super Bowl MVP), but KC's defense turned it up in the fourth and the Chiefs moved the ball against a great defense that gave them all sorts of problems for most of the middle quarters of the game.

Fun story time: I remember the Pats-Eagles Super Bowl in Feb of '05 (2004 season) That Walrus coached the Eagles. It was right after I had graduated from OSU and I was still living in Columbus, taking a year off to just fuck around and decompress. I remember that winter I walked a few blocks down to my friend's house down 4th ave with a chili cheese queso in my still-warm crockpot. I remember rooting for the Patriots because I fucking hated Terrell Owens. We were drinking Natty light and someone brought wings. I got really stoned and drunk and made out with a girl who lived next door to my friend. We had a table for beer pong and we made a snowman outside at halftime.  

My friend at that house was from my hometown and we worked together at a pizzeria. He didn't make it past December of 2017 because he developed a drinking/pill habit and eventually choked on his own vomit.   

Anyway sorry to get all dark. But that was one of my more memorable Super Bowl memories. He loved his beer and he was always a good dude to have a beer with. I have one every SB in his name. Here's to you, Horse. And congrats to the Chiefs",1580700718.0,8,:NFL: NFL

"I always enjoyed Richard Sherman. From the few games I watched Stanford and from when he was a Seattle CB fighting for a spot prior to Legion of Boom. I love his confidence and his cockiness. I made excuses for him after trashing the Seahawks and lying about Baker. One thing that is going to be super interesting is how he will implode following this loss. After he losses any big game he seems to blame everyone else. The 49ers lost this game by thinking a 10 point lead was either insurmountable or that they were the ones down by 10.


It seems the Offense and Defense never reached out to each other and asked the simple question of 'How do we want to proceed for these final seven'? This is where the youth of Shanahan is seen. He absolutely need to tell the defense what his plans are on offense,

Then mix it with youth and inexperience and Mahomes was bound to crack a bit. I do think the primary reason for his so so performance were nerves. Add on a strong defense he had to adjust to and it took him 3 quarters to get it together, rally the team and cross the finish line. Ultimately, he showed he has the mental toughness to be a winner and so I am not mad he won the MVP.
