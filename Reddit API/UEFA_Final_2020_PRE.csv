Both teams started nervous, lacking proper passing game. Bayern slowly went past that and started to play their game during the first half, Davies has been exploited by PSG, they made lots of plays on his side as he's clearly nervous.

PSG is focused on counters, and that worked well so far, when in possession they try to make long ball passes to the front three, mostly Mbapp√© without much success. I understand why the coach would put Ney as a striker, he can be ready to counter Bayern and Mbapp√© on the left follows Bayern's wide players alongside Bernat.

It was a good 45 min, I'm hoping for PSG to try to pass around Bayern midfield more with shorter passes, that way we can see more of Neymar.

For the first part of the 2nd half nothing much changed. Both teams continued their game plan as before.

Then Bayern scored.

And surpringsly not much changend again. Then came the subs on both teams. You could see PSG get more aggressive, as they should be. However again, overall nothing much changed.

These are two teams that can really cancel each other well.

"Amateurs review of the first half:

Both teams have obviously studied and prepared. Both sides mostly cancelled out each others offences. Still both sides also had one or two great chances so far.

Overall possession and play is slightly more on Bayerns side. Still the game is very open.

Two big BIG questions will be, a) how either coach adapts their tactics if needed and b) fitness and subs, this has been a very intese play stlye by both sides, how will it play out with tired players is a big question.

A very exciting 2nd half is upon us.",1598212379.0,8,:Borussia_Dortmund:
