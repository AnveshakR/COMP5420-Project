"Broncos fans, let me say one thing.

Come 6:30 EST, I will be an enemy. I will scream, I will curse Peyton Manning's name, I will wish dreadful harm every time Denver gets a first down, and I will probably rub it in your collective faces when we score. 

But for now, I still have some decency left. And I want to be a good sport. The Broncos are my second favorite team, and if they were playing anyone but the Panthers, I'd be rooting for you. So let's watch it all play out. Manning's last ride vs Newton's first. Super Bowl 50, with the two best teams in the league going head to head. Whatever happens over the next few hours, let's just agree that it should be a good one, and let's all hope that is one for the legends decades down the line.

Peace.
