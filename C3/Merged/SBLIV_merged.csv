""Gentlemen, I firmly believe that any man's finest hour... his greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear, is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle... victorious.. Gentlemen, THAT moment is waiting on you, it's waiting on every man in the 49ers locker room, it's waiting on every man in the Chiefs locker room.. What separates the Super Bowl from any other game.. is that a Super Bowl is always remembered.. it's not just another 60 minutes of football.. It's 60 minutes that can define you forever as a winner.. 

You know people ask ""Is winning the only thing?"", well my answer to them.. is my answer to you.. ""**ASK YOURSELF THE DAMN QUESTION""** IS WINNING THE ONLY THING TO **YOU?!!** IS IT WHAT **YOU** WANT?!! DO **YOU** WANT TO BE REMEMBERED AS A WINNER or as something else?

"One thing that repeats itself every SB with a big name MVP QB- they are surprisingly stifled. Even the example of the success story of an elite offense winning the SB (1999 Kurt Warner and the Greatest Show On Turf) were having trouble most of the game against the Titans. 02 Gannon, ‚Äò07 Brady, ‚Äò13 Peyton, ‚Äò16 Ryan - MVPs having trouble somewhere in the game and losing. Not to mention where ‚Äò04 Peyton, ‚Äò11 Rodgers,  ‚Äò18 Mahomes, ‚Äò19 Jackson ended up losing big playoff games. And it makes sense, this is the biggest test. 

I don‚Äôt see anything stopping the Locomotive 49er train today, rooting for Mahomes of course- but that‚Äôs not enough. My football eyes just don‚Äôt see it. If anything, that makes it even more exciting of Mahomes pulls this off.",1580683172.0,3,:Seahawks: Seahawks,Football,1

"Alright guys, I'm a European who only watches the Superbowl so I am a total noob when it comes to the game. However, I have watched [this 16 minute long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJt-K-TXYQI) from the NFL YouTube channel, which goes over the stats for both teams, so I'm basically an expert now. 

Only kidding of course. I'll give you guys my take on what I think, so please reply if you'd like!

From what I understood from the video ^(not much), it seems like the 49ers have the best shot? They do a lot of running, and KC has a pretty weak defence when it comes to stopping runs, it seems? KC is great at both throwing and running, but the 49ers seem to have one of the best all-round defensive lines. So to me, it looks like the Chiefs will have a hard time picking up yards, while SF might have an edge when it comes to running the ball.

Please reply if you think I'm wrong (or right, idk) on all of this. I'm looking forward to kick off!",1580682687.0,10,:Browns: Browns,Football,1

* The 49ers front four is great at pressuring the quarterback.  
* BUT Mahomes averages 8.4 yards per pass against a four man rush, and he's historically good as a scrambler.  
* San Francisco's running game has been great, especially as the season went on. They blew the Packers away in the NFC championship.  
* BUT the Chiefs just shut down David Henry and the historically great Tennessee running game.  
* The Chiefs have a deadly passing game and can score a lot of points in a hurry.  
* BUT the 49ers have the Number 1 offense in games where they trail by a touchdown, and the Number 3 defense in that same situation.

J-lo's part was a little more difficult to watch. Her singing felt very flat.

Parts of it felt like you could see her trying to remember which part came next and hesitating. And let's be honest, the songs are just not as good. But I'm not gonna dissect j-lo lyrics unless somebody pays me

Mahomes is a generational talent who was always going to win at least one and probably a couple before he hangs them up, so he might as well get his first while we are working our way back to contender status as far as I'm concerned. Hoping we can make this division truly competitive sooner than later but with what the Chiefs have on roster for the next two years or so before all their key pieces sign massive contracts, that's going to be a real challenge. 

Some headscratching coaching moments from Shanny and some poor throws in big moments from Jimmy G were a lot of the difference in this game, and Mahomes was not his usual casually dominant self for long stretches of this one (and didn't deserve MVP over Damien Williams IMO but the league was never gonna pass on a Mahomes Super Bowl MVP), but KC's defense turned it up in the fourth and the Chiefs moved the ball against a great defense that gave them all sorts of problems for most of the middle quarters of the game.

"Good to see the Walrus finally get his.  

Fun story time: I remember the Pats-Eagles Super Bowl in Feb of '05 (2004 season) That Walrus coached the Eagles. It was right after I had graduated from OSU and I was still living in Columbus, taking a year off to just fuck around and decompress. I remember that winter I walked a few blocks down to my friend's house down 4th ave with a chili cheese queso in my still-warm crockpot. I remember rooting for the Patriots because I fucking hated Terrell Owens. We were drinking Natty light and someone brought wings. I got really stoned and drunk and made out with a girl who lived next door to my friend. We had a table for beer pong and we made a snowman outside at halftime.  

My friend at that house was from my hometown and we worked together at a pizzeria. He didn't make it past December of 2017 because he developed a drinking/pill habit and eventually choked on his own vomit.   

Anyway sorry to get all dark. But that was one of my more memorable Super Bowl memories. He loved his beer and he was always a good dude to have a beer with. I have one every SB in his name. Here's to you, Horse. And congrats to the Chiefs",1580700718.0,8,:NFL: NFL,Football,3

"I always enjoyed Richard Sherman. From the few games I watched Stanford and from when he was a Seattle CB fighting for a spot prior to Legion of Boom. I love his confidence and his cockiness. I made excuses for him after trashing the Seahawks and lying about Baker. One thing that is going to be super interesting is how he will implode following this loss. After he losses any big game he seems to blame everyone else. The 49ers lost this game by thinking a 10 point lead was either insurmountable or that they were the ones down by 10.


It seems the Offense and Defense never reached out to each other and asked the simple question of 'How do we want to proceed for these final seven'? This is where the youth of Shanahan is seen. He absolutely need to tell the defense what his plans are on offense,

Add on a strong defense he had to adjust to and it took him 3 quarters to get it together, rally the team and cross the finish line. Ultimately, he showed he has the mental toughness to be a winner and so I am not mad he won the MVP.

On the other side, the Niners defense rattled Mahomes early and forced him into some mistakes, but he regrouped and demonstrated again why he's the best quarterback in the league and brought the Chiefs back.

Instructions

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a 9x13 inch pan with butter.

Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup fontina, 1/2 cup cheddar, 1/4 cup , mozzarella, 1/4 cup parmesan, 1/4 cup gouda, 1/4 cup gruyere and Panko bread crumbs. Set aside to use as topping later.
