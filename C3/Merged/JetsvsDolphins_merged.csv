> ""One of the running backs that he coaches is dancing with a girl, and Mike says, 'Listen, you're not dancing with her anymore or you're not playing with his team next year. So the guy says, 'What can I do?'

> ""So then McDaniel starts dancing with her. Four years later, they're married. Katie, that's how he met her. 'Hey you. Get off. *I'm* dancing with her.'"" 

(This was apparently when McDaniel was the running back coach for the Sacramento Mountain Lions in the UFL.)

So if Al Michaels is to be believed, McDaniel abused his authority as a coach to threaten one of his players in order to gratify his own desires.

"Ah yes because you used google and I didn’t makes me clueless🤦‍♂️. And just because Lance was injury prone doesn’t make him a bad qb. 

The Vikings were in a very similar situation as the Jets. They made a trade after Kirko got hurt and got Dobbs + a 7th rounder for a 6th rounder (I did my research to make you happy). Looking back, it was a great move by the Vikings, becuase they’re now in the playoff hunt with a solid qb.",1700877851.0,4,,Football,3

"Unfortunately, fuck DeSantis. 

I have to assume your “took out your defense” is in reference to your shitty ass field injuring players. Which is pretty scummy to be cheering for. Unless you think one touchdown is somehow winning against a defense that ran a 99 yard pick 6",1700874554.0,4,:Dolphins: Dolphins,Football,3

You don’t watch the games obviously 😂 the fact that we managed to win any games at all with the lowest ranked offense in the league is stunning. Acting like Rodgers wouldn’t make a difference is just a brain dead take but go off,1700877516.0,-1,:Jets: Jets,Football,3
"scrambling is actually the one thing Zach does well if you can believe that

hes pretty nimble and can throw on the run, it's delivering it in a not clean pocket is his problem among other things

I know what is said about him, but I promise he's not as bad as bad as poeple try to so hard to make him out to be, and he was the best option no question

Dobbs also didn't even look great last game lets not crown him yet imo",1700935635.0,3,:Jets: Jets ,Football,3
"the fact you had to research that says a lot lol

you already lost this argument when you said they should have traded for a bad qb before their own qb even got hurt lmao

"Respect, agreed, he sucks. 

No, that’s not what I meant and I should rephrase it. I was more making a joke about Boyle getting a touchdown and us finally converting a 3rd down. I hate seeing players get hurt, especially because our shit field does it way too often.

Dobbs isn’t the best. But he has the run and throw going for him. He makes up for his throws by running it through. Will he win a superbowl? Probably not but he is been a great sub on the Vikings thus far.,1700936359.0,1,:Dolphins: Dolphins,Football,3
"Dawg the only reason I did my research was to make u happy and now u mad about it💀. And to say Dobbs wouldn’t do better is nonsense. Dude was stuck on the Cardinals for the first half of the season. 

And only reason I brought up the Trey Lance situation was becuase u said nobody traded decent qbs. I’ll admit that wasn’t a great argument. But there is literally no counter argument that the Jets couldn’t of done the exact same thing as the Vikings.",1700879906.0,2,,Football,3

">  Dude was stuck on the Cardinals for the first half of the season

so youre saying when a qb is on a bad team they look bad? but when on a good team they look good?

so do you think dobbs would be a) bad on this bad team, or b) still bad because this team is bad and any qb would fail

Dobbs is not an upgrade from Zach, no qbs were, which is why they stuck with Zach, he was their best shot at winning",1700881201.0,1,:Jets: Jets ,Football,3

"No I’m saying Dobbs still played solid even on a bad team. But when players do good and lose no one rly cares. Same thing happened when Russ in the beginning of the season. It’s clear that Zach isn’t the sole problem on the Jets, but he isn’t the answer either.",1700882064.0,2,,Football,3
