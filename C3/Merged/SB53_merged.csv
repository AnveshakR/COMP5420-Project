"I think this is going to be the Sony Michel and James White show. Such a dangerous tandem and very difficult to game plan against. I‚Äôm just not confident in the Rams Linebacking core. I just watched that Peyton Manning tape analysis and the fact that the pats are using a true fullback and with Gronk being so proficient at blocking their run game is just so deadly and gives them so much opportunity to be balanced. 

I‚Äôm rooting for the Rams, for sure. I just worry they‚Äôre going to try and lay it all out in the first half and get gassed by the 4th where Brady Shines at finishing strong. 

I love this sub, I love football. It‚Äôs just a game though, remember to not take for granted of the time you get to spend with family and friends that you may or may not get to see as much outside of these events! ",1549227134.0,245,:Steelers: Steelers,Football,1

"this is suppose to be the 8th super bowl rematch 

Today's game between the Rams and Patriots marks the eighth rematch in Super Bowl history.

Good news for the Patriots: The team that won the previous matchup is 4-3. New England defeated the Rams, then in St. Louis, 20-17 back in 2002.

Pittsburgh and Dallas have met three times. Pittsburgh won the first rematch, a 35-31 thriller in Super Bowl 13. Then, 17 years later, Dallas defeated the Steelers 27-17.

Other rematches:

-Redskins 27, Dolphins 17 in Super Bowl 17; a rematch of Miami's perfection-capping victory in Super Bowl 7.

-Giants 21, Patriots 17 in Super Bowl 46; a rematch of New York's win, which spoiled New England's run at an undefeated season, four years earlier.

-Cowboys 30, Bills 13 in Super Bowl 38; a rematch of Dallas' crushing of the Bills the previous year.

-Eagles 41, Patriots 33 in Super Bowl 52; a rematch of New England's win in Super Bowl 39.

" For those haters (kinda sad tbh, though I know not everyone here is one) here are some stats, since you guys seem to like those.

Super Bowl records Brady owns:

Most games played, Most wins, Most passing touchdowns, Most passing yards overall, Most passing yards in a game, Oldest quarterback, Most 300-yard passing games (Brady has thrown for at least 300 yards four times Super Bowls XXXVIII, XLIX, LI, LII), Most passes without an interception, Most pass completions overall, Most pass completions in a game. 

These are only Super Bowl stats... there are so many others it's actually kind of ridiculous. Just a few other stats, to put things into perspective for some haters (though they will probably never stop hating, people hate on greatness).

Brady has nine postseason comebacks in the fourth quarter, which is the most in NFL history. To put that into perspective, John Elway and Joe Montana have nine fourth-quarter playoff comebacks combined. FURTHERMORE, Brady's contemporaries, Drew Brees, Peyton Manning, and Aaron Rodgers, only have five such comebacks between them. FIVE BETWEEN THEM. 

Oh and Tom Brady also has 6 super bowl rings... more than... any other player... ever. Since the stats obviously weren't enough (lol). ",1549260716.0,6,,Football,3

"To expand on the post-game media scrum last night:

For context, this was the scene [immediately following Super Bowl IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANGtrH8UGuM). These relatively subdued, locker room celebrations were the norm into [the mid-1990s.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvUqP0ZXehA) No on-field podiums, no on-field interviews, there's isn't even confetti. 

I cannot emphasize this enough:  If the public didn't hold this insatiable demand for soundbites and photos following sporting events, especially championship games, this wouldn't have happened. If the NFL didn't want all those people on the field after the game, they wouldn't have been there.

I mean think about it: unless you're from a newspaper or TV/Radio station from one of the participant's respective markets or a wire service or a national network, why on Earth would you send any of your personnel to this game? Don't you know how expensive it is to get just one writer and photographer out to the Super Bowl? Thousands of dollars that could be spent (perhaps more effectively) elsewhere. And that's just from the American press. There's a whole array of international reporters and photographers at the game. Do you really think the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/47112047) would send anyone to America for this game if there wasn't enough demand for it?

You can get on your moral high horse from now until kingdom come but it doesn't change the fact that those people wouldn't be ruining precious moments and memories for those players, coaches, and trainers (and their families) if the public didn't want it. If they didn't, they wouldn't be there and most of them probably wouldn't want to be there since sports desk deadlines are often the latest and most grueling to meet.",1549296083.0,5,:Commanders: Commanders,Football,3

3. Do not give Tom Brady any time left on the clock in the 4th quarter. 
4. Do not allow Bill Belichick to sign any white offensive skill players, otherwise they will become pro bowlers. ESPECIALLY THE UNDRAFTED ONES
5. Never, ever under any circumstances call the Patriots an underdog. You will immediately regret it.

It‚Äôs INSANE. Hah. I feel like it all started back in 5th grade when my teacher asked me to ‚Äústop calling out answers.‚Äù She STUNTED me. She STUNTED my thirst for knowledge. Because now I feel like I want to ‚Äúcall out the answers‚Äù but I can‚Äôt and it‚Äôs my own life, you know???

I feel like the challenge part of pilates is great but the soulful part of yoga is key. My mom said: FIND YOUR GUIDEPOSTS and I‚Äôm trying. That also got me thinking....what are guideposts? Are they man made? Are they physical objects? Or are they a feeling? An intuition? It‚Äôs not just going to say ‚Äúhi, I‚Äôm a guidepost.‚Äù You know? I want to find my life‚Äôs passion....but where to start? Also before I forget, my diet: currently consisting of potato chips and CEREAL....but is it helping me on my journey? I‚Äôm happy when I eat those things, they bring me joy....but is it really SERVING me? I find lately that the things I know are bad for me, are serving me the best. So I guess you could ask how well are they reeeeeally serving me then? I think that brings me back to high school, even though the school colors washed me out (we were the TIGERS.... I look terrible in orange). This has been an ongoing trend in my life; I need to break it. The color orange represents so many things to me now which shows how I have an inability to LET THINGS GO!
