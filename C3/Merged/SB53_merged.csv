"I think this is going to be the Sony Michel and James White show. Such a dangerous tandem and very difficult to game plan against. I’m just not confident in the Rams Linebacking core. I just watched that Peyton Manning tape analysis and the fact that the pats are using a true fullback and with Gronk being so proficient at blocking their run game is just so deadly and gives them so much opportunity to be balanced. 

I’m rooting for the Rams, for sure. I just worry they’re going to try and lay it all out in the first half and get gassed by the 4th where Brady Shines at finishing strong. 

I love this sub, I love football. It’s just a game though, remember to not take for granted of the time you get to spend with family and friends that you may or may not get to see as much outside of these events! ",1549227134.0,245,:Steelers: Steelers,Football,1

"this is suppose to be the 8th super bowl rematch 

Today's game between the Rams and Patriots marks the eighth rematch in Super Bowl history.

Good news for the Patriots: The team that won the previous matchup is 4-3. New England defeated the Rams, then in St. Louis, 20-17 back in 2002.

Pittsburgh and Dallas have met three times. Pittsburgh won the first rematch, a 35-31 thriller in Super Bowl 13. Then, 17 years later, Dallas defeated the Steelers 27-17.

Other rematches:

-Redskins 27, Dolphins 17 in Super Bowl 17; a rematch of Miami's perfection-capping victory in Super Bowl 7.

-Giants 21, Patriots 17 in Super Bowl 46; a rematch of New York's win, which spoiled New England's run at an undefeated season, four years earlier.

-Cowboys 30, Bills 13 in Super Bowl 38; a rematch of Dallas' crushing of the Bills the previous year.

-Eagles 41, Patriots 33 in Super Bowl 52; a rematch of New England's win in Super Bowl 39.

Fuck you refs. Thanks for creating one of the worst Super Bowls of all time. 

EDIT: When I’m talking about “#1” I’m talking about the best team in general. The patriots bested the AFC, making them the #1 team. 

The Rams got a lucky missed call that we all know if it was called correctly, the Saints had a very high chance of winning. 

And no I’m not salty. I was rooting for the Patriots for the very reasons I listed above.

" For those haters (kinda sad tbh, though I know not everyone here is one) here are some stats, since you guys seem to like those.

Super Bowl records Brady owns:

Most games played, Most wins, Most passing touchdowns, Most passing yards overall, Most passing yards in a game, Oldest quarterback, Most 300-yard passing games (Brady has thrown for at least 300 yards four times Super Bowls XXXVIII, XLIX, LI, LII), Most passes without an interception, Most pass completions overall, Most pass completions in a game. 

These are only Super Bowl stats... there are so many others it's actually kind of ridiculous. Just a few other stats, to put things into perspective for some haters (though they will probably never stop hating, people hate on greatness).

Brady has nine postseason comebacks in the fourth quarter, which is the most in NFL history. To put that into perspective, John Elway and Joe Montana have nine fourth-quarter playoff comebacks combined. FURTHERMORE, Brady's contemporaries, Drew Brees, Peyton Manning, and Aaron Rodgers, only have five such comebacks between them. FIVE BETWEEN THEM. 

Oh and Tom Brady also has 6 super bowl rings... more than... any other player... ever. Since the stats obviously weren't enough (lol). ",1549260716.0,6,,Football,3

"To expand on the post-game media scrum last night:

For context, this was the scene [immediately following Super Bowl IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANGtrH8UGuM). These relatively subdued, locker room celebrations were the norm into [the mid-1990s.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvUqP0ZXehA) No on-field podiums, no on-field interviews, there's isn't even confetti. 

I cannot emphasize this enough:  If the public didn't hold this insatiable demand for soundbites and photos following sporting events, especially championship games, this wouldn't have happened. If the NFL didn't want all those people on the field after the game, they wouldn't have been there.

I mean think about it: unless you're from a newspaper or TV/Radio station from one of the participant's respective markets or a wire service or a national network, why on Earth would you send any of your personnel to this game? Don't you know how expensive it is to get just one writer and photographer out to the Super Bowl? Thousands of dollars that could be spent (perhaps more effectively) elsewhere. And that's just from the American press. There's a whole array of international reporters and photographers at the game. Do you really think the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/47112047) would send anyone to America for this game if there wasn't enough demand for it?

You can get on your moral high horse from now until kingdom come but it doesn't change the fact that those people wouldn't be ruining precious moments and memories for those players, coaches, and trainers (and their families) if the public didn't want it. If they didn't, they wouldn't be there and most of them probably wouldn't want to be there since sports desk deadlines are often the latest and most grueling to meet.",1549296083.0,5,:Commanders: Commanders,Football,3

-Produced the worst halftime show in recent memory and crushed the hopes of many Spongebob lovers!

-Played refball all year and have done nothing to help your product!

-Ran garbage ads this year that resemble nothing like the memorable ads I still remember from 3-4 years ago!

-Gave us ANOTHER FUCKING PATS WIN THAT NOBODY WANTED

1. Never ever buy into the rumors that Tom Brady is losing a step, that Belichick and/or Brady are leaving, or anything like that.

3. Do not give Tom Brady any time left on the clock in the 4th quarter. 
4. Do not allow Bill Belichick to sign any white offensive skill players, otherwise they will become pro bowlers. ESPECIALLY THE UNDRAFTED ONES
5. Never, ever under any circumstances call the Patriots an underdog. You will immediately regret it. 
6. Enjoy it when the Patriots lose, but don't buy stock in the idea that that's the end of the Patriots.

">Warhol doesn’t finish the burger. Instead he bundles it back into its wrapper and container, crumples the mass of cardboard into a neat ball, and shoves the burger and ketchup bottle off to the side. After long moments of gazing at the camera, he utters the should-be-immortal phrase, “My name is Andy Warhol, and I just finished eating a hamburger.” **Actually, Warhol was disappointed that the burger wasn’t from McDonald’s.**

"Well, I’ve been just been thinking a lot about my “journey” and what that means to me as a person and you as a person and I feel like my life is moving in slow motion and I don’t really know how to stop it or make it go fast. It’s INSANE. Hah. I feel like it all started back in 5th grade when my teacher asked me to “stop calling out answers.” She STUNTED me. She STUNTED my thirst for knowledge. Because now I feel like I want to “call out the answers” but I can’t and it’s my own life, you know??? So that got me thinking about fitness and I’m just so torn between PILATES and yoga and what’s best for me at this moment. In this time of my life. I feel like the challenge part of pilates is great but the soulful part of yoga is key. My mom said: FIND YOUR GUIDEPOSTS and I’m trying. That also got me thinking....what are guideposts? Are they man made? Are they physical objects? Or are they a feeling? An intuition? It’s not just going to say “hi, I’m a guidepost.” You know? I want to find my life’s passion....but where to start? Also before I forget, my diet: currently consisting of potato chips and CEREAL....but is it helping me on my journey? I’m happy when I eat those things, they bring me joy....but is it really SERVING me? I find lately that the things I know are bad for me, are serving me the best. So I guess you could ask how well are they reeeeeally serving me then? I think that brings me back to high school, even though the school colors washed me out (we were the TIGERS.... I look terrible in orange). This has been an ongoing trend in my life; I need to break it. The color orange represents so many things to me now which shows how I have an inability to LET THINGS GO! I need to be content in my own choices and find my own path. I read this amazing article the other day about what color your aura is, and I found out that mine is actually ORANGE. How strange I am for wanting to cut that color out of my life.",1549242866.0,118,:Eagles: Eagles,Football,2

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this halftime show gave me cancer anyway.",1549243057.0,31,:Lions: Lions,Football,2
