They stuck with a QB they knew was not up to the task and have wasted the season.  FB careers are short for most players.  They can't afford throw away seasons. Saleh is now in real danger of losing this lockerroom. If this doesn't show at least some improvement,  he's gone and it's back to the drawing board.
