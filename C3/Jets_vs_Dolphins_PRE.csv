They stuck with a QB they knew was not up to the task and have wasted the season.  FB careers are short for most players.  They can't afford throw away seasons. Saleh is now in real danger of losing this lockerroom. If this doesn't show at least some improvement,  he's gone and it's back to the drawing board. This time, instead of going with the hot new coach or the QB just out of high school,  how about some competent veteran leadership. Someone who has done it b4 and knows how things work.

"Watching the Jets on Hard Knocks before the season, I thought the Jets would.be doomed if Rodgers got hurt.

Like literally told them that and included a sideshow of Rodgers too. My first thought was what if Rodgers, an old man in football years, gets injured? He zapped the ability of the offense to have any confidence if Rodgers goes down. it was a shitty coaching move imho.",1700862838.0,9,:Cowboys: Cowboys
