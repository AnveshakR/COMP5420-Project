"A lot of people in the comments seem to be questioning things today and yesterday so I'll explain. Currently the game is perfectly tied, which means that if the game continues this way then after the final whistle the game will go into extra time which consists of two fifteen minute halves with a five minute break in between. Then if the score is still exactly the same then it will go to penalties.

The away goal rule basically means if the aggregate score over the two games is tied then the team with more away goals goes through. The current scoreline is the only one in which the away goals can be equal. This mean that if Juventus score the next goal they will have more away goals and Real would have to outscore them over the two legs as a 4-4 draw would mean that Juventus goes through on away goals.

In other words the game is currently headed for extra time and if Juve score 4 Real need 5 and if Juve score 5 Real need 6 etc.

Hope this explains it to all the people who are unsure",1523478524.0,16,:edit_flair_on_desktop:

LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,1523474622.0,2,:c_Arsenal:
The fuck did they put in the water this week ,1523474622.0,2,:Morocco:
Well. this is getting out of hand,1523474622.0,2,:Canada:
Really missing Ramos ,1523474623.0,2,:Celtic:
"Modric seems to be hurt, he needs to get subbed off because it's gonna get a lot intense.",1523474623.0,2,
Carvajal marking Mandzukic is like Lahm marking Ibra,1523474625.0,2,

Real direly need Ramos,1523474677.0,2,
Real's right side is far too exposed. Marcelo keeps pushing up and Kroos/Vallejo can't really do everything there. Free crosses for Lichsteiner and Mandzukic can get free headers constantly like that.,1523474680.0,2,:Chelsea:

"Zidane’s Real Madrid defends horribly, and there’s been ZERO improvement in that front since he came. What do they even do in training?
