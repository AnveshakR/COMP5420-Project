Zidane's man-management of Ronaldo has got to be one of the best things that has happened to us this season. Getting him to accept his rationed game minutes so he can score less overall but score more meaningful goals is a testament to the respect and trust Zizou commands from him and all our players. Zizou has brought me such joy both as a player and as a coach. ,1496522505.0,1104,:Real_Madrid:

Rotterdam. #kony2012 ",1496522407.0,1836,:r_soccer_user:
"Allegri deserves a lot of blame for this. Conversely, Zidane deserves a lot of credit.

He fielded a two-man midfield of Khedira and Pjanic that never stood a chance against Isco, Kroos, Modric, and Casemiro. Predictably, Madrid completely dominated the midfield.

The decision to start Isco over Bale made perfect sense and it paid off big time for Zizou.

The one tactical advantage Juve had was that Madrid's fullbacks have to push far up the pitch to provide width due to Isco's central positioning and Ronaldo coming into the box.

So Juve could have used the space behind them... but completely failed to do that. Alves and Alex Sandro got forward sometimes, but Dybala and Mandzukic provided almost nothing out wide. It's also worth noting that Mandzukic did way too little to provide additional defensive solidity for the most part. He didnt come central enough to help clog up the midfield nor did he track Carvajal successfully enough. So what was the point of him, tactically? Yes he scored a brilliant goal. Sorry, thats not enough. Dybala was also not good enough.

IMO Allegri should have started with Marchisio to at least give Juve hope in the middle. As it were, they got totally outmatched.",1496522671.0,953,

Pjanic - quality player who let the game pass him by tonight. Strange performance suggests maybe the occasion got to him?

Allegri got his tactics embarrassingly wrong. Real Madrid exposed the flaws in the way they set up and they should've changed formation as soon as Mandzukic scored. Monaco exposed the flaws of their formation creating a few chances that a more clinical player would've converted and I said then they won't be as lucky against a team like Real Madrid. If a total dunce like me can spot it then Allegri should be able to. The space between the central defender and the right and left one is exploitable. Not only that but if Real Madrid are playing 4 midfielders and you're playing 2 then you're probably going to get dominated in midfield. Higuain was totally isolated up front. The amount of times he held the ball taking it out wide but there was no runs into the space he create was really really poor. ,1496523221.0,47,:Swansea_City:

"Absolutely ruthless Real Madrid. But, so sorry to say this, I think Allegri fucked up hugely.

We needed Alves as a right back. In no way should Barzagli be the starting RIGHT BACK against these players. Barzagli is awesome, but for fucks sake, he is 58 years old. Right back ?!

I think Cuadrado should have played from the start. Everything we lacked in attack, he could have provided it, if he played from the beginning. I mean come on, Higuain and Mandzukic were practically chained up front. They are not creative players, they are consumers for fucks sake. Dybala didnt do so well. 

Another thing I blame this on is the lack of competition in Serie A. I am absolutely sure that the fact that we have zero capable adversaries in the league is slapping our will to win from 1-2 in the face.

Midfielders were absolutely shit, but I expected that. The point was to utilize what we can, Cuadrado, as much idiot as he is, is an extremely fast winger who created chances and tore defences all season. Just look at the games against Barca. I still dont understand ..... why not Alves in the back, cuadrado in front of him ??? How can you place a 36 years old centre back at right back against players THAT FAST ?!

And for the love of God, what the fuck happened in the dressing room? I suppose he wanted them to kill the tempo or something, but we killed ourselves. An absolute tactical disaster in my opinion. But not a reason to hate. Everybody fucks up, especially us in finals, but I still have massive love for Allegri and all the guys that got us into the final. 
I just hope this doesnt kill the team mentally. We have to go again.

I guess Pjanic hasn't quite panned out for this Juve side...Pogba was still better. Dani Alves with the text message on how to lose the champions league final.

"Tactically, its not magic how RM came back to this. They pushed up, as with Athletico, its game of taking shots and peppering the goal until something happens. Juve to counter should have countered by maintaining a high line and pinning in the wingbacks inside to go toe-to-toe with RM midfield. You cannot allow MCM to control the midfield and expect to play a counter attacking game.

What made the 1st half that much more exciting was that the midfield was being contested and as a result the game was pretty end to end. I think Juve went to play to their strengths in defense rather than play a more attacking second half. That is pretty much the tactical error that allowed RM to build a dominance.

**Things We learnt**

* US Commentators are still shit - ""This team is better than the Gaalacticos"" 
* Brazilian Wingbacks are Awesome 
* Casemiro challenges are void in the 2016-17 season
* BCB are the last of a dying breed. But MKC must be the best midfield in the game
* Sergio Ramos feels no embarassment, what a shame to have such a technically brilliant player with such spineless sportsmanship

But wait! There's more! He actually pulls Dybala to put in, arguably, Juve's worst player this season, Lemina, in a move that literally made Juve fans say: ""*fuck my shit up, Allegri*""


He basically gifted the CL to Real.

Nonetheless, Real deserved the win. Total domination from the 10th minute onward. 

Now the most bold decision Juve should make is sack Allegri & sign Tuchel. Allegri has created Juve's most efficient formation but can not progress beyond that. They need someone who can lead the Old Lady beyond that. Someone with actual tactics.

So of course when they play,the results have a good reflection on the coach.

Let him go to a so-to-speak average club and revive the beast in them,win trophies and make them champions.

Then we will believe he is a great coach.

Coaches like Conte are potentially great coaches who had the ability to revive a comatose team.

Ramos is a cunt

Ronaldo had an incredible champions league but the circlejerk here will be incredible. I expect at least 100 ""But /r/soccer told me..."" comments about him in the next week or so. Still though, he's an incredible goalscorer.


To me, the game wasn't decided by the managers but just by the individual quality of Madrid's attackers and midfielders being a lot better than Juve's.

Ramos is a cunt

With Khedira not occupying a proper destroyer role, which is what suits him best, BBC were left way too exposed on the counter. They're all great CBs but they needed some form of protection, especially with the fullbacks bombing forward constantly.

Allegri also fucked up not bringing on subs earlier. For about 10 minutes before the second goal, Madrid were all over Juventus.

It worked incredibly good until half of the first time. Their goal and most clear options came from there. Now, if Allegri started with a 4-4-2, it would give more space to our fullbacks and get obliterated with crosses, so prior to the match was giving control of the midfield OR giving space for both teams fullbacks and in both senses RM had an upperhand.

Those who keep shouting Zidane is great are forgetting the fact that he is currently coaching the best team in the world with one of the best,if not the best squad.


70% of the players in Real Madrid are world bests.
So of course when they play,the results have a good reflection on the coach.

Let him go to a so-to-speak average club and revive the beast in them,win trophies and make them champions.

Then we will believe he is a great coach.

Coaches like Conte are potentially great coaches who had the ability to revive a comatose team.

Winning trophies in an already established club makes you lucky,not great.

Just ask Guardiola.

They were just completely out of it before that goal, they took the deflected goal pretty hard and the 3rd within a couple of minutes finished them off mentally.

Now about THIS years RM, they don't dominate the whole match or have the ball all the time but damn, when they decide to kill the opponent they do it. 20 minutes after mid half and the other team is done. They don't need 20-30 passes and 60%+ possesion before scoring. Just purely vertical play, one recover of the ball and the other team is dead. And I like this type of play, add to that the incredible great form of all 24 players (even fkn Danilo and Coentrao had some good runs).  
   
Of course I'm biased as RM fan, but if they  manage to get this years 4 (5?) titles I would say they are close if not on the same scale of Guardiola's 6 treble, with different styles.",1496546821.0,12,:Colombia:

There are only two things that Pep's Barca beat Zidane's Madrid in: **aesthetic value** and **the revolutionary approach/ideology** (the first which depends entirely on whether you like Tiki Taka or not). Remember, Barca under Pep had no plan B a lot of the time. As beautiful as their style was, it was to a degree, one-dimensional. It was always one style of tiki taka or another. This is evident in their matches vs Chelsea and Inter in 09, 10 and 12.

Madrid under Zidane however are so fluid with their style. They have a great build up play, they use the flanks effectively, they have superb aerial ability and almost everything else. Do you think this Madrid side would struggle *as much* as Barcelona did with Chelsea and Inter? I don't think so. And that is mainly because they are so versatile and effective.

This is just a silly parroted narrative. What is 'no plan B'? Because they didn't lump it to a big forward when they were losing? Tiki Taka was the core style, but Pep and Barcelona made so many adjustments that it is foolhardy to say they had no plan B. I mean at the start of Pep's tenure Messi was a wide player. He went from that to a false 9 and in Pep's last season delivered the greatest goalscoring season of all time...see how much he changed based on how Pep used him. 

>There are only two things that Pep's Barca beat Zidane's Madrid in: aesthetic value and the revolutionary approach/ideology

My solution would be to send the player that rolls on the floor to the sidelines for a medical checkup (if they roll 3 times and scream in pain surely somethings wrong /s) just to make sure there is no big injury, maybe keep them there for a period proportional to their real of simulated level of pain, although there's a big problem when there's a real foul and your in pain and now you also get removed from the game, but its a small one given that most of those you are sent to the sidelines anyway.

>There are only two things that Pep's Barca beat Zidane's Madrid in: aesthetic value and the revolutionary approach/ideology **(the first which depends entirely on whether you like Tiki Taka or not)**",1496531006.0,5,:Nigeria:
">Tiki Taka was the core style, but Pep and Barcelona made so many adjustments that it is foolhardy to say they had no plan B. I mean at the start of Pep's tenure Messi was a wide player. He went from that to a false 9 and in Pep's last season delivered the greatest goalscoring season of all time...see how much he changed based on how Pep used him.

All the adjustments were variations of Tiki Taka just like you've already said. All teams have a core style, but a lot of them also have alternatives. Pep's Barca had none. Pep's Bayern, however, had it. Changing formations or the positions of outfield players isn't all there is to having a plan B.

Remember when Pep joined Bayern? He injected his Tiki Taka philosophy, but they still had the cutting edge style of Heynckes to rely on.

>And tropies. Pep won a treble. And more league titles. He also won six trophies in a calendar year.

Agreed. But Zidane has won 2 CONSECUTIVE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TROPHIES. Could he have also won the league in his first season if not for Benitez's shitty start? The same season Madrid and Barcelona finished level on points? Probably. And we all know Madrid always half-arse the CdR.
He also has a shot at the quintuple this year. That's isnt that bad is it?


>They are relentless and efficient. But when you saw Pep's Barcelona play...you had to stop and watch. You got the feeling that you were watching something special because that just wasn't a way that people had seen football played before.

Which all boils down to the aesthetic value of Pep's style. And like I earlier admitted, he and his team got this Madrid on beat on that. I am not denying this, I am simply saying that *in spite of this*, I feel this Madrid are on par with the beautiful Barcelona team.

"no one has ever won the prem 5 times in a row, 3 is the maximum.

juve have won almost twice the amount of titles as both the milan teams, whereas in england 2 teams are very close whith the 3rd best team again almost having half, but by nowhere near as great a distance as the italian teams (english top two are on 21, arsenal on 13. juve 33, milan teams on 18)


no doubt, if juve were to come to the prem they'd be contenders, but it'd be very easy for them to get caught up in the competition and become a weaker side; no way they'd be able to sustain success like they do in seria a with 2 oil sides and united, the richest team in the world. spurs, pool and arsenal are rich enough to hold onto players and our players very rarely, if ever, have release clauses. You'd have to get them on the last year of contract, and if they are good enough to leave, trends show top prem players go to spain, not to italy. top players moving across top teams in the prem is also getting rarer.


juve is currently better than all prem teams, but if they joined the prem they'd get decline to the same level as our top clubs as united have ever since the oil money came into city and chelsea",1496524309.0,-1,
