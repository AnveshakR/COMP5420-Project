Yet now, there are only a few steps left to take for him to reach the summit. For him to finally show the world not as the man with a beautiful face, but as *I* see him. A man with a beautiful soul.

Gentlemen, THAT moment is waiting on you, it's waiting on every man in the 49ers locker room, it's waiting on every man in the Chiefs locker room.. What separates the Super Bowl from any other game.. is that a Super Bowl is always remembered.. it's not just another 60 minutes of football.. It's 60 minutes that can define you forever as a winner.. 

You know people ask ""Is winning the only thing?"", well my answer to them.. is my answer to you.. ""**ASK YOURSELF THE DAMN QUESTION""** IS WINNING THE ONLY THING TO **YOU?!!** IS IT WHAT **YOU** WANT?!! DO **YOU** WANT TO BE REMEMBERED AS A WINNER or as something else? 

Playing in the Super Bowl is about playing in a game that will define you forever... Make this game your finest hour..  I'll be waiting for you..""",1580678963.0,4,:Dolphins: Dolphins

"One thing that repeats itself every SB with a big name MVP QB- they are surprisingly stifled. Even the example of the success story of an elite offense winning the SB (1999 Kurt Warner and the Greatest Show On Turf) were having trouble most of the game against the Titans. 02 Gannon, ‘07 Brady, ‘13 Peyton, ‘16 Ryan - MVPs having trouble somewhere in the game and losing. Not to mention where ‘04 Peyton, ‘11 Rodgers,  ‘18 Mahomes, ‘19 Jackson ended up losing big playoff games. And it makes sense, this is the biggest test. 

I don’t see anything stopping the Locomotive 49er train today, rooting for Mahomes of course- but that’s not enough. My football eyes just don’t see it. If anything, that makes it even more exciting of Mahomes pulls this off.",1580683172.0,3,:Seahawks: Seahawks

"Alright guys, I'm a European who only watches the Superbowl so I am a total noob when it comes to the game. However, I have watched [this 16 minute long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJt-K-TXYQI) from the NFL YouTube channel, which goes over the stats for both teams, so I'm basically an expert now. 

Only kidding of course. I'll give you guys my take on what I think, so please reply if you'd like!

From what I understood from the video ^(not much), it seems like the 49ers have the best shot? They do a lot of running, and KC has a pretty weak defence when it comes to stopping runs, it seems? KC is great at both throwing and running, but the 49ers seem to have one of the best all-round defensive lines. So to me, it looks like the Chiefs will have a hard time picking up yards, while SF might have an edge when it comes to running the ball.

Please reply if you think I'm wrong (or right, idk) on all of this. I'm looking forward to kick off!",1580682687.0,10,:Browns: Browns

* The 49ers front four is great at pressuring the quarterback.  
* BUT Mahomes averages 8.4 yards per pass against a four man rush, and he's historically good as a scrambler.  
* San Francisco's running game has been great, especially as the season went on. They blew the Packers away in the NFC championship.  
* BUT the Chiefs just shut down David Henry and the historically great Tennessee running game.  
* The Chiefs have a deadly passing game and can score a lot of points in a hurry.  
* BUT the 49ers have the Number 1 offense in games where they trail by a touchdown, and the Number 3 defense in that same situation. 
* I have delicious pizza for the Super Bowl party.
