"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis ""the wise""? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.",1486335586.0,12,:Seahawks: Seahawks,Football,1

Wings: Buffalo style. Little less spice than I've done in previous years, but my first time trying a homemade buffalo sauce. It's delicious -- just not probably hot enough.

SALSA, on the other hand: Mango habanero. Super easy -- just gut a mango, dice an onion, and grab two peppers. Throw it all in the oven and heat it up for a bit, then turn on the broiler to really brown shit up. Take it out before it burns (eyeball that shit), pull the stems off, and dump it in a blender. Here's where I fucked up -- you want some lime juice, but not too much lime juice. I squeezed one and thought, man, that's not enough lime! I better throw in a second. Big mistake. Came out super bitter -- so I adjusted with some pineapple, brown sugar, and salt. Now it's edible -- maybe not THE BEST salsa around, but it's got a great spice profile and it's sweet and salty and pretty good -- just a bitter aftertaste that is impossible to be rid of at this point, I guess, lesson learned. edit: and cilantro, fuck.

To be better in your late 30s than your late 20s, without any suspicion of PED and deflating footballs being the only flaw on his resume (and even that is still up for debate, but newsflash: he doesn't need to do shit to his balls to be the best)... It's nuts. How many athletes have been better at 39 then 29? I can't think of any in team sports. He looks like he could play another 4 years. Down 25, off a lot of the night, to lock in and chip away and lead that comeback..

This was two completely different halves. You just don't blow a 28-3 lead. Especially in the Super Bowl. You've got a running back who was making cuts and getting 8 yards easily on most runs, and you just stop doing that, while you're trying to run the clock out anyway. Your defense is gassed. You're up 25 points with half the time of possession. Give them some time to catch their breath.

I watched the Patriots going up the field, worrying the whole time, then they got a touchdown, then another touchdown, then another, then we're in overtime. I was mad, but I knew we could still win, then they won the coin flip, then we got a penalty, then we're at the one yard line, then... I was fucking furious. I started going to town on ANYTHING IN MY SIGHT, lamps, electronics, You name it. I went into a blind fury, unleashing my rage on anything I could get my hands on, good thing my parents stopped letting me live in their house for free, or they might have gotten hurt. I punched my TV (it really hurt and I have a bruise now, but at the time i was so upset I didn't notice) and picked up my monitor and smashed it on the ground, leaving a very nasty crack in the screen. I took my rage outside my apartment and started banging on my neighbors door, SCREAMING. It was like I was in autopilot, I knew I was behaving irrationally, but at the same time, I didn't care, they won when we had a 25 point lead, I had been betrayed. I ran down the hallway to the elevator, I pressed for floor one and then pressed all the other floor buttons, I was not in a good state of mind. I ran outside into the cold and sobbed, partly from the pain in my hand, but mostly because my favorite team, the Falcons, failed me. They've failed me before, like when i picked ONLY Falcons players in the fantasy league and almost all of them sucked, or when i tried to buy a Falcons cookie cutter and got [this shit](https://www.amazon.com/F-16-Fighting-Falcon-Cookie-Cutter/dp/B00KD0IG6W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1486351998&sr=8-1&keywords=the+falcons+cookie+cutter), but those PAIL in comparison to this travesty, a 25 point lead and they lose, unforgivable. Outside, I was now just staring into the distance, wondering how they could have lost such a lead, when my landlord stepped out and asked me what I was doing, I said nothing, mysteriously walking past him and going to the stairwell (I wanted to take the elevator, but I pressed all the buttons and it was still going), I get back upstairs to see somebody at my door, asking about some banging on his door, I walked past him and ran inside, like I usually do.

"This game was kinda like a slow mo version of the decision to throw the ball from the 1 decision for Seattle 2 years ago. At least 3-4 separate occasions of that type of insane decision making/collapse from Atl. 

1) Matt Ryan taking a sack when they were in FG range followed by that holding penalty which if it didnt happen would have made the sack irrelevant. You simply have 3 shitty run plays and kick the FG, you win, no doubt about it.  

2) 5 wide on 3rd and 1 and the fumble in the 4th on Ryan 

3) Atl blatantly dropping at least one INT on Brady that would have sealed the game on that game tying drive of his 

The last one in particular is worth noting. Brady didnt play any differently regardless of whether that dropped game winning INT was caught or not. Except now youll hear tons of narratives of ""It's official Brady has to be the GOAT now because he led that come back and has 5 rings"" in a way nobody would have said had those INTs been caught. 

Ive said for a while for as popular as the NFL is the analysis of it is just way too simplistic and lacking in nuance. All the Brady takes that are going to come out inevitably about how this game has to seal his status as the GOAT because those INTs werent caught epitomize that in many ways. Whether or not you think he is or isnt the GOAT or regardless of what you think of him, him merely having a 5th ring shouldnt be influencing your perception at all. All you are doing it if it does is playing the result not evaluating how he actually played which is the only thing that matters. ",1486354389.0,1,,Football,3

"I disagree. I think the viper vs the mountain isn't an apt description. Its more like the trial by combat in the vale in season 1 when bronn fights the knight of the vale without any armor on. Everyone thinks the knight that has all the weapons and armor to easily win against the old gruff armorless bronn. However, Bronn by declining to wear armor tires the knight out by evading him for the entire fight and then cuts his legs out from under him before winning the battle at the last minute. 

That was how I viewed this superbowl. Early on everyone bets on Atlanta winning they have a lot of weapons and an aggressive offense and you're not sure how new england is gonna over come it, especially when they seemed to have made mistakes to start. However new england tires atlanta out leaving them defenseless at the end of the game. Atlanta's defense was on the field for 40 minutes new england's only 23.5. Atlanta's defense was gassed by the second half and didn't have time to try to score because new england's defense was always fresh. 

I didn't see atlanta doing anything to give the game up like the viper does. I saw them fail to see new england's long term scheme until their legs had already been cut out from under them. They looked to the coin toss (lysa arynn) for mercy, but there was none. So new england slit their throat and tossed them through the moon door. ",1486412597.0,1,:Eagles: Eagles,Football,3
