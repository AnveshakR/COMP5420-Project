"My NFL 96 game predicts that the Rams will win 35-33.   
Joe Burrow will throw 3 ints including a pick-6 and 2 touchdowns. Matt Stafford will throw 1 pick and 4 touchdowns. Joe Burrow will be sacked 5 times, while Matt Stafford will never be sacked.  
 Joe Mixon will average a measly 2.8 yards per rush attempt and have 3 touchdowns, while Cam Akers will average 4.9 with 1 touchdown. Joe Burrow will have around 70 rushing yards.   


The Bengals will convert a 4th and 4 via a fake punt on their own 26 right before halftime. There will be four 2-pt conversion attempts, only one of which is successful. The score will be 22-13 Rams, going into the fourth quarter.  


 In the fourth quarter, Joe Burrow will throw the pick-6, but the Bengals will score two more tds, and the rams one more after that to make the score 35-26. The Bengals will then attempt an onside kick and recover the ball after a Rams player fumbles. The Bengals score a TD (35-33) and try another onside kick. Unfortunately, it will be unsuccessful, and the Rams will run out the clock with three straight kneels. The Rams win their second Lombardy, and the Bengals suffer a close defeat.",1644792978.0,4,:Steelers: Steelers,Football,1

"The NFL has a significant problem with officiating. I don’t believe the game was fixed, but all season long referees have called games inconsistently, especially in tight situations where winners are decided. The result is that fans, players, and coaches don’t trust the game to be called fairly, and especially in light of the integration of sports betting, it casts a pall on the trustability and integrity of the league and the game. I hope the NFL addresses it moving forward, but I doubt they will.

At one point when that 3rd strong TE made his 3rd catch he said ""This is what Stafford is reduced to.""  Like it was so horrible that he had to throw to a backup tight end.  Geez, how about pointing out that this guy was stepping up to help out his team with Beckham out injured.  No, they were ""reduced to"" throwing to this guy - just a terrible comment.",1644851379.0,5,,Football,3

"May be an unpopular opinion with many, but this was probably one of the best overall Super Bowl evenings in years.

Two teams that no one really expected to get here, both having great players and stories (Joe Burrow/Jamarr Chase bromance, Matthew Stafford's escape from Detroit, etc.), a very close game,  ref involvement wasn't all game (though there were some missed and bad calls), a halftime show that highlighted some huge, influential artists out of the area (and almost entirely rap/R&B, which years ago would have been taboo).

Outside of this evening, I would say it has been definitely a good year for football. There are things we should still demand more of, including better refereeing/higher standards of refs, reassessment on OT rules, and overall change in certain rules that are ridiculous (""taunting"",  lightly grazing the QBs arm and getting a RTP), but for our first year back to ""normalcy"", this was a very successful year.",1644822562.0,12,:Cowboys: Cowboys,Football,3

The Bengals seemed to grab all the momentum off of 2 consecutive plays to start the 2nd half, the Burrow TD pass and then the subsequent Stafford INT. They basically rode those 2 plays for as long as they could the rest of the game, but it just wasn't enough. The Rams' defense would not let the game get out of hand. Bengals management needs to get Burrow an O-line like yesterday!

On all those flags in the last 2 minutes, I think the first one was the only bad one, which if that doesn't even get thrown, the other flags might not ever happen since it would have been 4th down and the defense had all the momentum at that point. I feel like the Bengals' D was primed to win the game the way the Rams' D ended up doing. It's a ""what could have been"" moment.",1644859277.0,4,:Eagles: Eagles,Football,3

But, honesty, the ending fell flat. Could have been more appealing to watch on both ends if there wasn’t flags everywhere late in that last Rams drive.

Everyone is playing so tense and carefully. There is a lot of downtime - many more commercials, longer half time show, hard to get any kind of rhythm going. The Super Bowl has a very artificial feel to it. I find the rest of the playoffs to be much more entertaining.

But I don't want to poop on the parade, it wasn't a bad game or anything, I just think Super Bowls feel a lot different than any other games in the season, but not necessarily in the good way, there's just something unsatisfying about them, when they should be the perfect way to end to a season.",1644838940.0,5,,Football,3

I feel for the Bengals, but if there is a silver lining, they know what they need to improve. FA, and the draft should primarily be spent improving their offensive line.

"Overall I enjoyed this game and am happy it was close and am also happy to see a team like the Bengals get their shot. 

Congratulations to Stafford and all the other Rams players on their win. They played better defensively and drove the ball when it mattered. Cincinnati just couldn’t get it done between poor O line play, bad play calls at crucial times and crucial drive ending drops. I thought the Rams were the better team today even though the Bengals kept it close and had an opportunity to win. 

Reffing was still awful. I think the no call OPI to start the second half was just a genuine miss. Impossible to speculate on how the game goes if that is called so it’s not worth the time. However, the refs were allowing some contact all game even in the red zone and end zone without throwing flags. Really sucks to see them completely change up their posture when it gets down to the last two minutes and all of a sudden turn a game that was really notable for its lack of calls into one which is going to be defined by controversial penalties.",1644855893.0,2,,Football,3

1 - Great game overall, it was enjoyable.

2 - The Bengals easily could’ve won if they didn’t try to get tricky running shotgun on 4th and 1, or if they handed off to Mixon on 3rd and 1.

3 - Then again, the Bengals never should’ve had that one touchdown, because of the absolutely blatant face mask

4 - I feel bad for Super Bowl losers, genuinely. Even when my team is the winner. What a tough thing to get within inches of your goal and lose.

5 - This whole “home team winning the super bowl” thing hopefully won’t become a trend, it feels oddly unfair.

6 - Cincinnati needs to hire an entire ass offensive line this off season; they were somehow worse than Pittsburgh

7 - Last one for the conspiracy theory crowd who thinks the NFL is rigged; The key art of the game was Aaron Donald and Joe Burrow, not Matthew Stafford and Joe Burrow… and look how the game ended with Aaron Donald sacking Joe Burrow.

"Zac Taylor’s play calling cost his team the super bowl. 

The pass rush was insane from the front line of the Rams and he kept calling medium to long passing routes and going 4-5 wide out. Pass after pass in a game where he had the lead. Although his offense is usually dynamic, that o line could not hold against the creative pass rush from the Rams, aided by their all star hall of fame talent. Burrow was clobbered. They failed to adjust to run the ball & switch to short passes to move the chains until it was too late. 

It’s a pity, because the Bengals looked like they had it but those missteps opened the window just enough for Matt Stafford, one of the most clutch quarterbacks of all time... and Kupp... one of the greatest if not the greatest WR of all time... to snatch victory and their Super Bowl rings along with their place in the history books, when it all looked certain to be slipping away.

Mcvay for as anxious and panicked as he looked on the sideline... he adjusted, adjusted & kept his team fighting. Showing that the scars they gained from the Patriots, weren’t for nothing like with the Falcons... they learned and it made them stronger... and they’ve reached the mountain top. Finally over the hill after betting everything to win. 

It’s bittersweet to see the Amazing story of the Bengals to come to this end, I’ll remember this Super Bowl as them having a chance... but just falling short to a heroic all time effort from Donald, Kupp, and Stafford.",1644808442.0,2,,Football,3
