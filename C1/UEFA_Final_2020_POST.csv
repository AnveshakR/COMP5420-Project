"Strange to say, but this CL run by Bayern, at least in some ways, reminded me of the 2014 World Cup and Germany's win. Some obvious similarities include:

\-German sides winning it obviously, with some of the same players between the squads of course.

\-Both Germany and Bayern having exceptional standout performances that will echo through the ages as absolutely unbelievable, utterly destroying what was once considered the ultimate powerhouse of football within a specific era or context. Those results being the 7-1 and the 8-2 of course. Same margins too!

\-Both finals ending 1-0, with the losing side in PSG and Argentina missing huge chances to go ahead earlier and ruing those misses. Also a superstar shattered by the missed chance to go down in history for winning the holy grail for their respective sides, and solidifying their own legacy (Messi and Neymar being the paralleled figures here, of course).

\-Flick being a part of both glorious triumphs, naturally! What a manager he seems to be.

\-The CL itself becoming more like the WC from the quarters onward, with the one-legged ties and the drama that entails. 

There may be even more to the comparison, even though it means little really, and some of it might just be confirmation bias anyway, seeing what I expect and all. Anyway, it's just an interesting parallel to make, but mostly just a fun set of comparisons to contemplate.

Congrats Bayern, up there with Liverpool now with their own number 6, and with this treble done in enthralling fashion now arguably one of the best club seasons ever, and surely up there with their 2013 monster season to boot!

Condolences to PSG, I may not have wanted them to win due to what they represent within the sport (as many of us have pointed out here already, Qatar and all), but I do still feel for the players and Tuchel, well fought!",1598219302.0,392,:AEK_Larnaca:

Thiago was brilliant on and off the ball. Covered and helped the back line brilliantly and then picked so many good passes through PSG‚Äôs midfield. Knew went to slow things down and pick the tempo up. 

PSG although they couldn‚Äôt get too much control of the game did her right thing trying to play quickly behind the likes of Kimmich.

"I call this the German vs Germain Derby.

It was a very entertaining, tactical game... so on-point that the overall flow of the game was very predictable. That tells me that, in hindsight, PSG should've tried something different earlier in the game.

Neuer made great saves but hard to put any Bayern player over others. They all played their role to the letter, including Davies who grew into it after half time.

Most of the great moments from PSG came through Neymar when Kimmich had gone up too far as noted on TV at half-time. Bayern did well to minimize play down that side and only play in Gnabry towards goal rather than get Kimmich involved. Relying on Coman/Davies was not only sufficient but the diagonal passes to Neymar was easily stopped. Biggest moment probably was Mbappe missing that terrible Bayern mistake that nobody expected. Though, it's very likely that it may not have changed the eventual outcome.

The few chances PSG had were inevitable with the talent in their attack but they just couldn't exert any presence in the midfield and after about 30 minutes of exhilarating pace that they couldn't keep up. Eventually, the Bayern press started to become too difficult to handle and the ball was basically given up for the rest of the game.

PSG didn't have too many choices as the bench options looked not quite good enough for this particular game and level, which was clear when the subs did happen. The only thing I thought PSG could do was to switch Neymar and Mbappe around the 70min when it was clear that Neymar is all out of gas. They did do so but much later in the game in hopes that Neymar could create something. Considering possession and the type of scraps PSG had all 2nd half, this should've been done midway through the half. Neymar almost had something for Chupo-Moting at the end after he was more centrally positioned.

Ultimately, the game analysis is all about how PSG could've chased the game cuz Bayern didn't look like they were going to lose even with the chances they gave up because at the very end was Neuer and at the very front was Lewandowski. I just shook my head watching Coman and Gnabry come off for Perisic and Coutinho. Crazy squad.",1598217443.0,31,:Manchester_United:

That wasn't the only reason PSG lost. Obviously, Neuer was phenomenal and PSG couldn't even score with their talisman, Marquinhos ""the striker.""

Bayern are just a better and more experienced *team*. The pressing, in particular, was really well executed. Destroyed PSG's deep buildup and choked off the supply lines Mbappe and Neymar.

Muller : Utterly tireless man. Tackling hard in opposite third in the 80th min, shows his commitment. 3-4 peach of crosses, opening the defence.

I'll be honest, I personally wanted PSG to win because of the trio Neymar, Thiago Silva and Marquinhos (and also for Di Maria, I really like the guy), I was wishing to see Thiago Silva lifting the CL trophy and becoming the biggest idol in the history of the club.

That being said I can't get mad at Bayern winning it, what a team and what a season, probably one of the best teams to win the CL and it was totally deserved.

Thought both teams started pretty nervy and made basic mistakes,1598235604.0,2,
"PSG changed their style of play and dropped deeper to counter the press.

A high press can only work if the attacking team commit enough players forwards to limit the passing options of the defence. e.g. There is no way for two attackers to successfully  'high press' against a back four + goalkeeper. You need to commit enough attackers to have a 1:1 ratio.

A team can counter the high press by dropping back midfielders to outnumber the pressing team.

Once the team in possession drops players back, the 'pressing team' are disadvantaged because they can be passed around and they have less players behind the ball to defend an attack.

This means that the high press becomes  not only ineffective and high risk but also the pressing players burn off lots of energy doing sprints to close down players who have easy passing options.

But, in terms of tactical disruption, the high press has worked since it has made the opposition team drop deeper in to their own half.

After being pressed for the initial period in tonight's game, the PSG midfield were forced to adapt and came deeper for defensive passes. The keeper also kicked long. Arguably, this was a successful outcome of the Bayern strategy of stopping PSG from building attacks from the back.",1598233864.0,1,:r_soccer_user:

"I think PSG got asphixiated during some parts of the second half. It looks like Tuchel decided the first line (especially Mbappe & Neymar) were only supposed to press in Bayern's half, then stay there if it failed and let the others do the job so they'd be in a good position to receive the ball from them and counter fast.   
But at times, it seemed PSG just could not get one proper pass to the midfield (i.e. Neymar) without getting intercepted by the Bayern's high pressing so Neymar and Mbappe simply had nothing to do. 

It really did not feel that Neymar broke down mentally to me, whenever Neymar received a good pass and the guys around him raced forward, he managed to produce something and create danger, and he kept running to the very end when he had to. He might not have been godlike like in his previous matches, but I felt he was still solid. For the sake of comparison, I felt Mbappe kept overthinking things.",1598371789.0,1,:Olympique_Lyonnais:

Neymar is one of the most skillful players in the game currently. Every team knows this and the way they try to get to him is by going as hard as possible as a mental game. Neymar is aware of this and he‚Äôs also aware of the fact that a lot of fouls just don‚Äôt get called when you don‚Äôt fall even if they would have otherwise been clear. He also seems very worried that he‚Äôll be injured (as he has been) from his opponent way of playing so it‚Äôs kind of his protection. To get the foul every time so that the opposing team will either:

A) stack up on yellow cards
B) allow him to play more freely because they‚Äôre scared of giving away free kicks / penalties.
