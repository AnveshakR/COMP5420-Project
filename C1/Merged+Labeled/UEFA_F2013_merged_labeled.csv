The guy was probably involved in 90 percent of all the chances of Bayern. Corners in the first half. Brilliant through ball to Muller in the second half. Constantly finds himself in great positions to score. People hating on him for not passing should watch every Bayern CL match this season and have to find out it's simply untrue.


Still after every chance he misses even every Bayern fan gives him the finger. Then he gives a great assist and there are so many people here writing down extremely cliched responses as: ""wow Robben passes"". Cut this guy some slack. 9 goals and 7 assists in 18 games this season. So many of these were vital assists and goals of him this year in the CL. Maybe even the most important Bayern player this year.


I honestly don't get what he's doing wrong. Ribery gives an elbow, dives, hits players, but that's still a standup guy. Robben plays his heart out, scores the winning goal and gives an assist, but he is obviously the bad guy here...

"**WOW WHAT A COMPLETE GAME.  IT HAD EVERYTHING.**

**General:**  Bayern went to ground faaaaaar too much and I have NO IDEA how Dante didn't get sent off for a 2nd yellow after that foul in the box.  I mean UEFA is all about consistency yet the referees actions rarely follow suit with UEFA's words.  At least Gundogen converted.  It would be a real shame if Dortmund loses so many key players, like they've already lost Gotze.  Such a young, energetic team with potential to become even better than they already are.  Defensively the game was enjoyable to watch (especially the Subotic save), offensively it was fun to see all the chances being created, the energy and the pace.  

**Neuer/Weidenfeller:**  Brilliant game from both of them.  Neuer kept so many, what I thought were inevitable goals, out.  Weidenfeller about the same.  I think the shots Neuer stopped were a tad more difficult but either way they were both spectacular in goal.  Not that anyone would, but I don't think you can really fault either goalkeeper for much of anything in today's match. 

**Robben:**  It's not a popular opinion given all of the comments I read on the match thread and post match thread so far but honestly with all of the 1-on-1 chances, Robben should've netted at least one of them (and he did).  I wouldn't exactly call his performance *amazing* or anything.  I believe most other players would've done better with the chances given to them.  You could argue they wouldn't have the same off the ball movement as Robben to even create those chances but I'm looking at it from a purely finishing perspective.  His finishing *isn't* good, he just finally completed what was statistically bound to happen sooner or later.",1369516345.0,27,,Soccer,3,N

">Still after every chance he misses even every Bayern fan gives him the finger.

They didn't. I just returned from a very taxing viewing at our local bar (90% reds there) and people were definitely giving him the credit that he deserves. He was unfortunate in many recent finals (World Cup, last year UCL) but what people are realizing now is how much of a stand-up guy he is. Coming back like he did the second half of the season after all those failures, that's not easy to do and deserves some appreciation.

"It matters. Rules are rules and the ref officially has no discretion. A called penalty is an automatic yellow, Ribery should have been carded for the dive and the elbow to the face and Lewandowski should have been shown red for stepping on Boateng's ankle at least.

Both challenges vs. Müller were outside of the box btw. but I agree that he should have gotten at least one yellow for that.

It was a great game nonetheless but the refereeing was pretty bad and I hate it that the UEFA always pretends that the rules matter and should be enforced just to give out unofficial recommendations to the refs before important games because they are afraid to offend viewers or affect ratings.

I agree that refs should have the freedom to decide on a situation by situation basis but nothing stops the UEFA from adapting the rules to allow for just that.

As it stands the ref's call was against the rules and people aren't haters just for pointing that out.

If the ref had exercised more control over the game and actually enforced UEFA's rules he would pretty much  have had to send Ribery, Dante and Lewandowski off the pitch for their conduct.

"Damn dude that is a hard question.  I'm not the biggest fan of Robben but from what I know, between injuries and the financial state of Madrid, it was probably the right call.  As far as I can tell, Robben is someone who wants to start and get the full 90 minutes but I'm not sure if that would happen with a team like Madrid at this point.  His off the ball movement to create chances and the pace at which he does it, is something I would like on Madrid still.  I don't think we had the most creative year this year.  Most of the creativity comes from Ozil in the middle with Alonso backing him as a playmaker.  Naturally Ronaldo creates plays as well.  On paper, Robben would probably be better for Madrid down the right side with Ronaldo down the left but when it's all said and done, I guess his fitness + recouping some money by selling him was a good enough move.

Long story short, I'd probably take him over Di Maria at this point down the right side so I guess I'd prefer to have kept him...I think.  Damn this is hard.  :(",1369521261.0,3,,Soccer,3,N

**Youth level** 

Subotić was part of the squad selected and coached by John Hackworth for the US entry in the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship during September 2005 in Peru. Sixteen years of age at the time, he entered all three group matches as a sub during the final five minutes. In the quarterfinal versus the Netherlands that the US team lost 0–2 and got eliminated, he played from the start, but got red carded in the 73rd minute.

He has also made two appearances for the USA U-20 team. What would prove to be his last one took place in November 2006 in a friendly after which head coach Thomas Rongen criticized Subotić, who had signed for Mainz several months earlier, for ""not accelerating over there to the point where we feel he belongs on the [U.S.] team"". Next summer, Rongen controversially did not select him to play in the 2007 U-20 World Cup in Canada – picking defenders such as Nathan Sturgis, Anthony Wallace, Julian Valentin, Ofori Sarkodie, Tim Ward, and Amaechi Igwe ahead of Subotić – decision that has resulted in Rongen receiving a fair amount of criticism. While Rongen insisted that a groin injury was to blame, there has been considerable speculation since then that Subotić was so stung by Rongen's criticism that he decided to reconsider his international future:

""Well, Rongen certainly said some discouraging and false things about me. Never in my life have I heard that a high level coach publicly criticizes a player. Professional coaches do that one-on-one with the player. I find this disappointing, because a few months later after Rongen said I was not good enough for the U-20s, I played a very good season and started getting calls from various countries [U.S. included] for the full men's team. I still don't know what he saw in the other players, and what he didn't see in me.""


**Full squad** 

Subotić was eligible to represent the United States, Serbia, or Bosnia-Herzegovina.During September 2008, when the issue of his national team eligibility first started getting wider coverage in the football media, playing for Croatia or even Germany were mentioned as possibilities as well, however both options were soon revealed to be media concoctions more than anything else. Bosnia-Herzegovina fell out of the running early as Subotić publicly rejected overtures by the country's football officials and head coach Miroslav Blažević.

By late fall 2008, it became clear that only Serbia figured in his international choice. Citing sources close to Subotić's family, many reports in the Serbian press appeared about his decision to play for Serbia already being made, but waiting for the right moment to state it publicly since he had until 10 December 2009 (his 21st birthday) to declare his choice. In mid December 2008 Subotić informed national team head coach Radomir Antić about his decision to represent Serbia.[4][15] Then in late December 2008, Subotić notified US Soccer Federation about his decision – the first official step in the process of changing national team attachment.

**2010 World Cup qualifying** 

On 28 March 2009, Subotić made his debut for the Serbian national team, in the 2010 World Cup qualifier against Romania in Constanţa that Serbia won 2–3. 

TL;DR: He can't play for the USA since he's cap tied to Serbia, also Thomas Wrongen was an idiot.  That list of reject defenders that got played instead of him is pretty hilarious in retrospect.  Wish Klinsmann had been in charge then.",1369524268.0,2,:r_soccer_user:,Soccer,3,N

> fighting with someone in the club.

People at the club generally like him and there's a reason why he's been our captain in quite a few matches when Lahm and Schweinsteiger were not playing. 

>  Yeah yeah he had a great year

The way you talk about his performance I very much doubt you see him play very often. He's had a stellar season and was probably the best player in the Bundesliga. 

>  I sincerely hope he moves on this summer

Do you even care about Bayern winning? There's no player in the world he couldn't compete with (excluding Ronaldo and Messi as I am sure they aren't human. They just can't be.). He's a very important part of our team and also a great mentor for a lot of young players like Alaba and Shaqiri.

>In the late 1990s Subotić family's residence authorization in Germany expired and in order to avoid being deported back to Bosnia[3] they opted to move to the USA in 1999. They settled in Salt Lake City where Subotić's father had a cousin.[2] Subotić played football with Sparta Gold and Impact Black youth clubs. Within two years the family was on the move again, this time to Bradenton, Florida so that Subotić's sister Natalija could pursue a tennis career at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy.[2] The city also happens to be the base for the United States U-17 national team. Subotić trained on his own in G.T. Bray Park where he got spotted by Keith Fulk, one of the US team's assistant coaches who then informed the team's head coach John Ellinger about Subotić. After arranging a tryout, they offered Subotić a spot in the residency camp. At the time he was not attached to any club sides, but eventually started playing with the University of South Florida team. While playing with the U-17 team in the Netherlands, Subotić was approached by player agent Steve Kelly who inquired about his career plans and offered a possibility of playing in Europe. After impressing at the tryout for 1. FSV Mainz 05, young Subotić was on his way there, initially playing for the club's youth and fourth-division teams (1. FSV Mainz 05 II).[2]

Your team is incredible and just won the Champions League. I don't like Franck Ribery. He's undoubtedly a good player, but that's irrelevant to you referring to me as a sore loser.

Have you bothered looking at pictures of her? She had breast implants for crying out loud, not fresh ones either. There is no way you'd think she's 17. Needless to say she was in the business for several years. Hence why the court won't condemn him.

Good thing I didn't do that then. I state I don't like him for off the field actions (there's your ""foul"" media attention) and for some of his on the field actions as well (games/highlights I've watched myself). I also call him a good player in my previous post. I'm not discrediting him from being a good player who has contributed to a final win, I'm calling him an asshat who's actions apart from his talent don't leave me thinking he's deserving as an overall person. If you stripped everything excess away and just considered his talent and contributions alone, of course he's deserving.",1369591616.0,1,,Soccer,3,N

Which, unless the process of coming to the conclusion was bullshit/set up, makes those people pretty fucking stupid.

If you weren't refering to the underaged thing, were you simply saying that you look down upon him because he consulted a prostitute? 

>he's deserving as an overall person

In what kind of a carebare world do you live in? Are you honestly tying morals to success in one's job when he isn't even doing amoral things *while* doing it? It's pretty straight forward with him. You provoke him, he blows up. Is Zidane an asshole? Would you consider Großkreutz an undeserving asshole too then? I wouldn't.  It's part of Ribery's upbringing.

Hmm not all too familiar with the US system but I'm rarely if ever grossed out by German law (as a student of law). I feel my condition (unless the process of coming to the conclusion was bullshit/set up) was enough.

Would you go into a court while practicing and call the judge ""fucking stupid"" after he ruled against you?

> Nice try at dodging the other arguments however. Typical sore loser (of arguments) behavior.

You called me fucking stupid and can't stand that I don't like one of your players. I initially declined to respond because you're being a hypocrite in your statements. You continually call me a sore loser despite having congratulated Munich on victory and simply having a bad opinion of Ribery, yet you have said nothing to indicate you're a good winner.You're sitting here calling people who don't like a court's decision and one of your players fucking stupid.

> If you weren't refering to the underaged thing, were you simply saying that you look down upon him because he consulted a prostitute?

Perhaps because he was married and a practicing Muslim. I respect everyone's beliefs (and unlike you I don't call people fucking stupid for dissenting); I don't like hypocrites.

Ribery's actions on the field are disgusting at times and it's not a one off thing. He acts like an absolute diva and is malicious towards others. Who the player happens to be is irrelevant; I'm disgusted with Lewa for his actions last night--the difference is he hasn't been pulling that type of shit for years on end.",1369596279.0,1,,Soccer,3,N
