"Great game from Dias Stones Dii Marco and Ederson, the rest were in the good old big game panic scramble.

I don't think Lukaku was as bad as people say here, yes he could have done better on the header but immediately improved the team when he came on. Lautaro has a lot of grit but did very little after winning the ball

"It stings and it will take some time to go away. Especially since we were equals and Man City didn't even play great. I said it would take something to be heartbroken in this match, since everyone expected us to lose anyway... But to lose like this, with such chances, after a shitty rebound goal by Man City... That hurts... 

Hats off to the lads, to Inzaghi, to everyone. What a campaign we had. We put in a great challenge at the trophy. Manchester City didn't struggle against anyone like they did with us. Nobody thought we'd make it to the finals and everyone though we'd get smashed. Emotions aside, it's been a good season.",1686430614.0,338,:Inter_Milan:

"You can meme Lukaku all you want, Dimarco's fucking awful header had nothing to do with him, but it is a fact that Inter looked far more dangerous with him on the pitch than they did with Dzeko, who contributed absolutely fuck all.

"Am I crazy for thinking they should've just started Lukaku? Dzeko did fuck all and Lukaku was way more involved in the game and actually had chances to score, he definitely wasn't their worst player.

Clearly the plan was to let them play rough, and yeah it caused him to miss a couple fouls each way he should have whistled for. They were all in the middle of the pitch though, and he didn't really miss any obvious cards in that. The game was flowing well without interruption, he didn't allow players to bullshit, and VAR didn't have to intervene once. So I'd say overall he did his job.

I won't lie I only tried to pay attention to the positions/space of the players for around 60'ish minutes before praying for the Lakaka memes to come true. However... 

I thought Inter did fantastic and were one of the few teams this season to give City a real fight.(especially defensively) City interestingly this time went for a back 3 with ONE PIVOT in Rodri. Stones/Gundogan occupied the  LCM/RCM with De Bruyne occupying the CAM position. They probably went with this shape because man to man Inter defended with 2 up top / 3 in the midfield outnumbering the usual double pivot formation City have had this season. 

City defended with 4 uptop and constantly pressured the 3 Inter defenders. However Onana was fantastic and was amazing at his feet. Constantly finding long balls to distribute away from that press/find the Wingbacks. Lukaku especially was amazing at receiving long balls to cushion for his teammates, creating chance after chance. (Don't ever let anybody say Lukaku played bad this game, he was phenomenal and created chaos in the City back line) Just unlucky in the end. 

MVP should go to Ederson just for keeping City alive in the end lol. City were a fun team to watch this season, and looking at it from a pure footballing perspective deserved this UCL. Pep finally found the solutions to his problems, constantly tinkering and experimenting. Whether its anything in life that type of forward thinking will yield you something new. New tactics for attacking/ defending.... exploiting specific areas of the field... finding overloads, etc. It's why he is one of the greatest managers in football.",1686460552.0,3,

for fucks sake inter…. i don’t want to shit on them too much cause they genuinely impressed me, did so much better than i expected. the fact that it was actually close for the whole game is seriously impressive. but man the worst part is city weren’t even that good, inter genuinely could have won it but just bottled so many chances. fucking lukaku man, that guy is genuinely cursed, he’s like a walking meme. lukaku and martinez might be the worst duo up top i’ve seen. and my club employed weghorst. 

but for fucks sake it’s actually happened. city have won the ucl…. the end is near. no more no ucl jokes 😪.. 

and treble winners to make it 10x worse. can pep actually fuck off now that he’s done it.

They can't buy our opinions but be damn sure they can buy the support of especially international supporters who don't understand the harm being done. Our last hope is the rules violations in England, but if we're truly being honest with ourselves the FA and other governing bodies simply do not have the resources to take on an entire nation state. It's a shame because 15 years ago everyone was condemning Chelsea for the financially juiced club they were, yet City took that model into the stratosphere. And here we are. I won't be surprised if in 10 years only City, Newcastle, RM and PSG are the only clubs capable of winning a European Cup. And I won't be surprised when, outside of the oil clubs, youth engagement with football falls off a cliff and the game moves from community staple to the franchise, only wealthy allowed model we have in the US.

So when teams don’t mark Haaland, he scores. When they don’t double team Bernardo/Mahrez or Grealish/Foden they create or score. And if they don’t close down the edge of the box in front of goal, then KDB/Rodri/Gundo score. 

It’s a bit of a fluke goal, but it’s part of their system. Gundo scored 2 from there in the FA cup. Rodri and KDB scored against Bayern/Real Madrid from there. It’s a fluke, but it’s not.",1686438157.0,7,
"
> City's goal came from the one moment in the game where there was no Inter player to immediately close down the City player.

That's just what you can do when you have some of the very best midfielders in the sport. Rodri, Gundogan, Bernardo, De Bruyne, they can all take that shot and they need only one chance (Gundogan Vs Man Utd got two...). Even Stones is starting to take those shots - not well yet, but who knows. And then these guys rotate positions with the likes of Foden, Grealish, and Mahrez - keeping all of them starved of space is a very hard job.

I think Old Pep has started to embrace the idea that not everything can be set up as a tactic, not every game is won on the whiteboard - you need a solid plan and a good idea of how players should link up, but there is something that you cannot predict, something for which you just need great players. 10 years ago he wouldn't have bought a Haaland, maybe not even 5 years ago...

Its a trade off they probably had to make, but both strikers did the job they were asked to do, besides actually scoring...",1686440824.0,1,:Manchester_United:

And only one of their quadruples was done with 4 most prestigious trophys available to them .. 

Celtic have 1 quadruple.  When they won the European cup, The League, The FA Cup and The league Cup. 

Literally click on 5 titles in one season and tell me if it has bayern or barca there? It does not. It has celtic

Not click on 6 titles in one season and tell me if it has bayern or barca there?  It does not.  

Celtics European Quadruple with all homegrown players  (or quintuple if you count mickey mouse trophys) is a greater story than both bayern and barcas quadruples, bayerns was more impressive than barcas as it was a euro quad.  . They never done a sextuple as evidenced by the wiki page you sent.

For Bayern or Barca to do a Sextuple they would need to first win the UCL or Europa League in season 1.  This would get them Super cup for season 2. 

They would have to win their league or domestic cup in season 1 also.  This would qualify them for their domestic super cup in season 2

Now in season one they've won a double minimum. 
Now season 2 is where they can win a Sextuple. 

They would have to win Euro super cup, Domestic Super cup, domestic cup , league, Champions league in season 2 for it to be a Sextuple. ( If they win the Club world cup in this season also, its a whatever the feck a seventuple is)
