"Just wanted to say something here. What the fuck is up with all the Robben hate. I might be slightly biased as a Dutchmen but this is getting out of hand.


The guy was probably involved in 90 percent of all the chances of Bayern. Corners in the first half. Brilliant through ball to Muller in the second half. Constantly finds himself in great positions to score. People hating on him for not passing should watch every Bayern CL match this season and have to find out it's simply untrue.


Still after every chance he misses even every Bayern fan gives him the finger. Then he gives a great assist and there are so many people here writing down extremely cliched responses as: ""wow Robben passes"". Cut this guy some slack. 9 goals and 7 assists in 18 games this season. So many of these were vital assists and goals of him this year in the CL. Maybe even the most important Bayern player this year.


I honestly don't get what he's doing wrong. Ribery gives an elbow, dives, hits players, but that's still a standup guy. Robben plays his heart out, scores the winning goal and gives an assist, but he is obviously the bad guy here...

Could maybe someone explain it to me?

"**WOW WHAT A COMPLETE GAME.  IT HAD EVERYTHING.**

**General:**  Bayern went to ground faaaaaar too much and I have NO IDEA how Dante didn't get sent off for a 2nd yellow after that foul in the box.  I mean UEFA is all about consistency yet the referees actions rarely follow suit with UEFA's words.  At least Gundogen converted.  It would be a real shame if Dortmund loses so many key players, like they've already lost Gotze.  Such a young, energetic team with potential to become even better than they already are.  Defensively the game was enjoyable to watch (especially the Subotic save), offensively it was fun to see all the chances being created, the energy and the pace.  

**Neuer/Weidenfeller:**  Brilliant game from both of them.  Neuer kept so many, what I thought were inevitable goals, out.  Weidenfeller about the same.  I think the shots Neuer stopped were a tad more difficult but either way they were both spectacular in goal.  Not that anyone would, but I don't think you can really fault either goalkeeper for much of anything in today's match. 

**Robben:**  It's not a popular opinion given all of the comments I read on the match thread and post match thread so far but honestly with all of the 1-on-1 chances, Robben should've netted at least one of them (and he did).  I wouldn't exactly call his performance *amazing* or anything.  I believe most other players would've done better with the chances given to them.  You could argue they wouldn't have the same off the ball movement as Robben to even create those chances but I'm looking at it from a purely finishing perspective.  His finishing *isn't* good, he just finally completed what was statistically bound to happen sooner or later.",1369516345.0,27,

That's something I heard from some analysts a couple of days ago. I'm not sure I agree with that 100%, but I think it was a very good point. BvB had an amazing first 25 minutes, but as time when on they really started to slow down. By the final 20 minutes, and for most of the second half before that, it was Bayern making chances left and right. Just like in the end of the game at Madrid, Dortmund was scrambling after Bayern trying to get it back and do something, but just couldn't settle back in the game.

Dortmund fans would still reject him because he went of to Bayern, and Bayern fans would never accept him because he took the the Trophy away from them. Just remember what a hard time Neuer had in the beginning.

They didn't. I just returned from a very taxing viewing at our local bar (90% reds there) and people were definitely giving him the credit that he deserves.

Coming back like he did the second half of the season after all those failures, that's not easy to do and deserves some appreciation.

I have to say that as a life-long Bayern supporter, I am proud to have (had) him on the team. He is polarizing but he is not at all the douchebag that people are constantly trying to make him into. He may be the greatest right-winger Bayern ever had.",1369527765.0,18,:r_soccer_user:

He's a choker, although he did finish that goal extremely cool, he has proven multiple times he can't handle the pressure.

There was a time he was heavily overrated by every hipster in town (he's underrated by them now)

When he's on the right (I hate it when he is) and the defender pushes him out he becomes so helpless with his right foot it's actually pathetic.

"It matters. Rules are rules and the ref officially has no discretion. A called penalty is an automatic yellow, Ribery should have been carded for the dive and the elbow to the face and Lewandowski should have been shown red for stepping on Boateng's ankle at least.

Both challenges vs. Müller were outside of the box btw. but I agree that he should have gotten at least one yellow for that.

It was a great game nonetheless but the refereeing was pretty bad and I hate it that the UEFA always pretends that the rules matter and should be enforced just to give out unofficial recommendations to the refs before important games because they are afraid to offend viewers or affect ratings.

I agree that refs should have the freedom to decide on a situation by situation basis but nothing stops the UEFA from adapting the rules to allow for just that.

As it stands the ref's call was against the rules and people aren't haters just for pointing that out.

If the ref had exercised more control over the game and actually enforced UEFA's rules he would pretty much  have had to send Ribery, Dante and Lewandowski off the pitch for their conduct.

This doesn't change even if the game turned out to be brilliant despite that",1369524114.0,-3,

His off the ball movement to create chances and the pace at which he does it, is something I would like on Madrid still.  I don't think we had the most creative year this year.  Most of the creativity comes from Ozil in the middle with Alonso backing him as a playmaker.  Naturally Ronaldo creates plays as well.  On paper, Robben would probably be better for Madrid down the right side with Ronaldo down the left but when it's all said and done, I guess his fitness + recouping some money by selling him was a good enough move.

"For the lazy:

**Youth level** 

Subotić was part of the squad selected and coached by John Hackworth for the US entry in the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship during September 2005 in Peru. Sixteen years of age at the time, he entered all three group matches as a sub during the final five minutes. In the quarterfinal versus the Netherlands that the US team lost 0–2 and got eliminated, he played from the start, but got red carded in the 73rd minute.

He has also made two appearances for the USA U-20 team. What would prove to be his last one took place in November 2006 in a friendly after which head coach Thomas Rongen criticized Subotić, who had signed for Mainz several months earlier, for ""not accelerating over there to the point where we feel he belongs on the [U.S.] team"". Next summer, Rongen controversially did not select him to play in the 2007 U-20 World Cup in Canada – picking defenders such as Nathan Sturgis, Anthony Wallace, Julian Valentin, Ofori Sarkodie, Tim Ward, and Amaechi Igwe ahead of Subotić – decision that has resulted in Rongen receiving a fair amount of criticism. While Rongen insisted that a groin injury was to blame, there has been considerable speculation since then that Subotić was so stung by Rongen's criticism that he decided to reconsider his international future:

""Well, Rongen certainly said some discouraging and false things about me. Never in my life have I heard that a high level coach publicly criticizes a player. Professional coaches do that one-on-one with the player. I find this disappointing, because a few months later after Rongen said I was not good enough for the U-20s, I played a very good season and started getting calls from various countries [U.S. included] for the full men's team. I still don't know what he saw in the other players, and what he didn't see in me.""


**Full squad** 

Subotić was eligible to represent the United States, Serbia, or Bosnia-Herzegovina.During September 2008, when the issue of his national team eligibility first started getting wider coverage in the football media, playing for Croatia or even Germany were mentioned as possibilities as well, however both options were soon revealed to be media concoctions more than anything else. Bosnia-Herzegovina fell out of the running early as Subotić publicly rejected overtures by the country's football officials and head coach Miroslav Blažević.

By late fall 2008, it became clear that only Serbia figured in his international choice. Citing sources close to Subotić's family, many reports in the Serbian press appeared about his decision to play for Serbia already being made, but waiting for the right moment to state it publicly since he had until 10 December 2009 (his 21st birthday) to declare his choice. In mid December 2008 Subotić informed national team head coach Radomir Antić about his decision to represent Serbia.[4][15] Then in late December 2008, Subotić notified US Soccer Federation about his decision – the first official step in the process of changing national team attachment.

**2010 World Cup qualifying** 

On 28 March 2009, Subotić made his debut for the Serbian national team, in the 2010 World Cup qualifier against Romania in Constanţa that Serbia won 2–3. 

TL;DR: He can't play for the USA since he's cap tied to Serbia, also Thomas Wrongen was an idiot.  That list of reject defenders that got played instead of him is pretty hilarious in retrospect.  Wish Klinsmann had been in charge then.",1369524268.0,2,:r_soccer_user:

Hahaha. Do you even follow Bayern? He's had one season where he was very unlucky with injuries. He's playe 236 games for us since 2007. That's nearly fourty games per season. 

> fighting with someone in the club.

People at the club generally like him and there's a reason why he's been our captain in quite a few matches when Lahm and Schweinsteiger were not playing. 

>  Yeah yeah he had a great year

The way you talk about his performance I very much doubt you see him play very often. He's had a stellar season and was probably the best player in the Bundesliga. 

>  I sincerely hope he moves on this summer

Do you even care about Bayern winning? There's no player in the world he couldn't compete with (excluding Ronaldo and Messi as I am sure they aren't human. They just can't be.). He's a very important part of our team and also a great mentor for a lot of young players like Alaba and Shaqiri.

Robben is just as high maintenance as Ribery.

>In the late 1990s Subotić family's residence authorization in Germany expired and in order to avoid being deported back to Bosnia[3] they opted to move to the USA in 1999. They settled in Salt Lake City where Subotić's father had a cousin.[2] Subotić played football with Sparta Gold and Impact Black youth clubs. Within two years the family was on the move again, this time to Bradenton, Florida so that Subotić's sister Natalija could pursue a tennis career at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy.[2] The city also happens to be the base for the United States U-17 national team. Subotić trained on his own in G.T. Bray Park where he got spotted by Keith Fulk, one of the US team's assistant coaches who then informed the team's head coach John Ellinger about Subotić. After arranging a tryout, they offered Subotić a spot in the residency camp. At the time he was not attached to any club sides, but eventually started playing with the University of South Florida team. While playing with the U-17 team in the Netherlands, Subotić was approached by player agent Steve Kelly who inquired about his career plans and offered a possibility of playing in Europe. After impressing at the tryout for 1. FSV Mainz 05, young Subotić was on his way there, initially playing for the club's youth and fourth-division teams (1. FSV Mainz 05 II).[2]

Unfortunately people get away with stuff like that all the time (e.g. Lewandowski today) 

However, even if there is no excuse for this behaviour, I can kind of understand those players.

Perhaps because he was married and a practicing Muslim. I respect everyone's beliefs (and unlike you I don't call people fucking stupid for dissenting); I don't like hypocrites.
