Wings: Buffalo style. Little less spice than I've done in previous years, but my first time trying a homemade buffalo sauce. It's delicious -- just not probably hot enough.

SALSA, on the other hand: Mango habanero. Super easy -- just gut a mango, dice an onion, and grab two peppers. Throw it all in the oven and heat it up for a bit, then turn on the broiler to really brown shit up. Take it out before it burns (eyeball that shit), pull the stems off, and dump it in a blender. Here's where I fucked up -- you want some lime juice, but not too much lime juice. I squeezed one and thought, man, that's not enough lime! I better throw in a second. Big mistake. Came out super bitter -- so I adjusted with some pineapple, brown sugar, and salt. Now it's edible -- maybe not THE BEST salsa around, but it's got a great spice profile and it's sweet and salty and pretty good -- just a bitter aftertaste that is impossible to be rid of at this point, I guess, lesson learned. edit: and cilantro, fuck.
