Wings: Buffalo style. Little less spice than I've done in previous years, but my first time trying a homemade buffalo sauce. It's delicious -- just not probably hot enough.

SALSA, on the other hand: Mango habanero. Super easy -- just gut a mango, dice an onion, and grab two peppers. Throw it all in the oven and heat it up for a bit, then turn on the broiler to really brown shit up. Take it out before it burns (eyeball that shit), pull the stems off, and dump it in a blender. Here's where I fucked up -- you want some lime juice, but not too much lime juice. I squeezed one and thought, man, that's not enough lime! I better throw in a second. Big mistake. Came out super bitter -- so I adjusted with some pineapple, brown sugar, and salt. Now it's edible -- maybe not THE BEST salsa around, but it's got a great spice profile and it's sweet and salty and pretty good -- just a bitter aftertaste that is impossible to be rid of at this point, I guess, lesson learned. edit: and cilantro, fuck.

This was two completely different halves. You just don't blow a 28-3 lead. Especially in the Super Bowl. You've got a running back who was making cuts and getting 8 yards easily on most runs, and you just stop doing that, while you're trying to run the clock out anyway. Your defense is gassed.

I watched the Patriots going up the field, worrying the whole time, then they got a touchdown, then another touchdown, then another, then we're in overtime. I was mad, but I knew we could still win, then they won the coin flip, then we got a penalty, then we're at the one yard line, then... I was fucking furious. I started going to town on ANYTHING IN MY SIGHT, lamps, electronics, You name it. I went into a blind fury, unleashing my rage on anything I could get my hands on, good thing my parents stopped letting me live in their house for free, or they might have gotten hurt. I punched my TV (it really hurt and I have a bruise now, but at the time i was so upset I didn't notice) and picked up my monitor and smashed it on the ground, leaving a very nasty crack in the screen. I took my rage outside my apartment and started banging on my neighbors door, SCREAMING. It was like I was in autopilot, I knew I was behaving irrationally, but at the same time, I didn't care, they won when we had a 25 point lead, I had been betrayed. I ran down the hallway to the elevator, I pressed for floor one and then pressed all the other floor buttons, I was not in a good state of mind. I ran outside into the cold and sobbed, partly from the pain in my hand, but mostly because my favorite team, the Falcons, failed me. They've failed me before, like when i picked ONLY Falcons players in the fantasy league and almost all of them sucked, or when i tried to buy a Falcons cookie cutter and got [this shit](https://www.amazon.com/F-16-Fighting-Falcon-Cookie-Cutter/dp/B00KD0IG6W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1486351998&sr=8-1&keywords=the+falcons+cookie+cutter), but those PAIL in comparison to this travesty, a 25 point lead and they lose, unforgivable. Outside, I was now just staring into the distance, wondering how they could have lost such a lead, when my landlord stepped out and asked me what I was doing, I said nothing, mysteriously walking past him and going to the stairwell (I wanted to take the elevator, but I pressed all the buttons and it was still going), I get back upstairs to see somebody at my door, asking about some banging on his door, I walked past him and ran inside, like I usually do.

Brady is GOAT I think.  Just my opinion.  Not sure about Belichick.  My only argument about him is there is another coach in another sport that's done about the same in Pop.  It's hard to think the best NFL coach might be matched with someone during the same time frame in another sport who is not.. Pop could be GOAT too but people wouldn't buy it as much.

"This game was kinda like a slow mo version of the decision to throw the ball from the 1 decision for Seattle 2 years ago. At least 3-4 separate occasions of that type of insane decision making/collapse from Atl. 

1) Matt Ryan taking a sack when they were in FG range followed by that holding penalty which if it didnt happen would have made the sack irrelevant. You simply have 3 shitty run plays and kick the FG, you win, no doubt about it.  

2) 5 wide on 3rd and 1 and the fumble in the 4th on Ryan 

3) Atl blatantly dropping at least one INT on Brady that would have sealed the game on that game tying drive of his 

The last one in particular is worth noting. Brady didnt play any differently regardless of whether that dropped game winning INT was caught or not. Except now youll hear tons of narratives of ""It's official Brady has to be the GOAT now because he led that come back and has 5 rings"" in a way nobody would have said had those INTs been caught. 

Ive said for a while for as popular as the NFL is the analysis of it is just way too simplistic and lacking in nuance. All the Brady takes that are going to come out inevitably about how this game has to seal his status as the GOAT because those INTs werent caught epitomize that in many ways. Whether or not you think he is or isnt the GOAT or regardless of what you think of him, him merely having a 5th ring shouldnt be influencing your perception at all. All you are doing it if it does is playing the result not evaluating how he actually played which is the only thing that matters. ",1486354389.0,1,,Football,3,N

"I disagree. I think the viper vs the mountain isn't an apt description. Its more like the trial by combat in the vale in season 1 when bronn fights the knight of the vale without any armor on. Everyone thinks the knight that has all the weapons and armor to easily win against the old gruff armorless bronn. However, Bronn by declining to wear armor tires the knight out by evading him for the entire fight and then cuts his legs out from under him before winning the battle at the last minute. 

That was how I viewed this superbowl. Early on everyone bets on Atlanta winning they have a lot of weapons and an aggressive offense and you're not sure how new england is gonna over come it, especially when they seemed to have made mistakes to start. However new england tires atlanta out leaving them defenseless at the end of the game. Atlanta's defense was on the field for 40 minutes new england's only 23.5. Atlanta's defense was gassed by the second half and didn't have time to try to score because new england's defense was always fresh. 

I didn't see atlanta doing anything to give the game up like the viper does. I saw them fail to see new england's long term scheme until their legs had already been cut out from under them. They looked to the coin toss (lysa arynn) for mercy, but there was none. So new england slit their throat and tossed them through the moon door. ",1486412597.0,1,:Eagles: Eagles,Football,3,N

Pats were trying to give it away for three quarters.

An argument can be made that much of the Falcons lead was self-inflicted by the Pats.

That being said, I'm totally fine with the semi-sudden death OT.  The reality is either team had 60 minutes to win in regulation.  If you didn't take care of it then, you don't get to cry about it in OT.

Joe Burrow will throw 3 ints including a pick-6 and 2 touchdowns. Matt Stafford will throw 1 pick and 4 touchdowns. Joe Burrow will be sacked 5 times, while Matt Stafford will never be sacked.  
 Joe Mixon will average a measly 2.8 yards per rush attempt and have 3 touchdowns, while Cam Akers will average 4.9 with 1 touchdown. Joe Burrow will have around 70 rushing yards.   


The Bengals will convert a 4th and 4 via a fake punt on their own 26 right before halftime. There will be four 2-pt conversion attempts, only one of which is successful. The score will be 22-13 Rams, going into the fourth quarter.  


 In the fourth quarter, Joe Burrow will throw the pick-6, but the Bengals will score two more tds, and the rams one more after that to make the score 35-26. The Bengals will then attempt an onside kick and recover the ball after a Rams player fumbles. The Bengals score a TD (35-33) and try another onside kick. Unfortunately, it will be unsuccessful, and the Rams will run out the clock with three straight kneels. The Rams win their second Lombardy, and the Bengals suffer a close defeat.",1644792978.0,4,:Steelers: Steelers,Football,1,N

Two teams that no one really expected to get here, both having great players and stories (Joe Burrow/Jamarr Chase bromance, Matthew Stafford's escape from Detroit, etc.), a very close game,  ref involvement wasn't all game (though there were some missed and bad calls), a halftime show that highlighted some huge, influential artists out of the area (and almost entirely rap/R&B, which years ago would have been taboo).

Outside of this evening, I would say it has been definitely a good year for football. There are things we should still demand more of, including better refereeing/higher standards of refs, reassessment on OT rules, and overall change in certain rules that are ridiculous (""taunting"",  lightly grazing the QBs arm and getting a RTP), but for our first year back to ""normalcy"", this was a very successful year.",1644822562.0,12,:Cowboys: Cowboys,Football,3,N

"This was a strange game. Low-key, this was more of a defensive battle despite the final score. Neither offense was ever clicking the entire game. The Bengals seemed to grab all the momentum off of 2 consecutive plays to start the 2nd half, the Burrow TD pass and then the subsequent Stafford INT. They basically rode those 2 plays for as long as they could the rest of the game, but it just wasn't enough. The Rams' defense would not let the game get out of hand. Bengals management needs to get Burrow an O-line like yesterday!

On all those flags in the last 2 minutes, I think the first one was the only bad one, which if that doesn't even get thrown, the other flags might not ever happen since it would have been 4th down and the defense had all the momentum at that point. I feel like the Bengals' D was primed to win the game the way the Rams' D ended up doing. It's a ""what could have been"" moment.",1644859277.0,4,:Eagles: Eagles,Football,3,N

1. Bengals got away with that TD in early 3rd, obvious PI

3. Cooper Kupp proved that WRs should have a better chance of winning MVP

But, honesty, the ending fell flat. Could have been more appealing to watch on both ends if there wasn’t flags everywhere late in that last Rams drive.

Again, that's no slight at the Bengals, they would not have been here if it was just the Burrow and Chase show, it's more of a compliment to the Rams than anything.

You need a guy capable of competing with the young guns like Burrow, Mahomes, Herbert and Allen, but just as important is the team around him, thus, the lesson to learn is that every great quarterback needs help to succeed.

Everyone is playing so tense and carefully. There is a lot of downtime - many more commercials, longer half time show, hard to get any kind of rhythm going. The Super Bowl has a very artificial feel to it. I find the rest of the playoffs to be much more entertaining.

But I don't want to poop on the parade, it wasn't a bad game or anything, I just think Super Bowls feel a lot different than any other games in the season, but not necessarily in the good way, there's just something unsatisfying about them, when they should be the perfect way to end to a season.",1644838940.0,5,,Football,3,N

I feel for the Bengals, but if there is a silver lining, they know what they need to improve. FA, and the draft should primarily be spent improving their offensive line.

"Overall I enjoyed this game and am happy it was close and am also happy to see a team like the Bengals get their shot. 

Congratulations to Stafford and all the other Rams players on their win. They played better defensively and drove the ball when it mattered. Cincinnati just couldn’t get it done between poor O line play, bad play calls at crucial times and crucial drive ending drops. I thought the Rams were the better team today even though the Bengals kept it close and had an opportunity to win. 

Reffing was still awful. I think the no call OPI to start the second half was just a genuine miss. Impossible to speculate on how the game goes if that is called so it’s not worth the time. However, the refs were allowing some contact all game even in the red zone and end zone without throwing flags. Really sucks to see them completely change up their posture when it gets down to the last two minutes and all of a sudden turn a game that was really notable for its lack of calls into one which is going to be defined by controversial penalties.",1644855893.0,2,,Football,3,N

1 - Great game overall, it was enjoyable.

2 - The Bengals easily could’ve won if they didn’t try to get tricky running shotgun on 4th and 1, or if they handed off to Mixon on 3rd and 1.

3 - Then again, the Bengals never should’ve had that one touchdown, because of the absolutely blatant face mask

4 - I feel bad for Super Bowl losers, genuinely. Even when my team is the winner. What a tough thing to get within inches of your goal and lose.

5 - This whole “home team winning the super bowl” thing hopefully won’t become a trend, it feels oddly unfair.

6 - Cincinnati needs to hire an entire ass offensive line this off season; they were somehow worse than Pittsburgh

7 - Last one for the conspiracy theory crowd who thinks the NFL is rigged; The key art of the game was Aaron Donald and Joe Burrow, not Matthew Stafford and Joe Burrow… and look how the game ended with Aaron Donald sacking Joe Burrow. Chris Collinsworth always saying “YoU cAn’T mAkE tHiS sTuFf Up!” but they literally showed us up front.

"Zac Taylor’s play calling cost his team the super bowl. 

The pass rush was insane from the front line of the Rams and he kept calling medium to long passing routes and going 4-5 wide out. Pass after pass in a game where he had the lead. Although his offense is usually dynamic, that o line could not hold against the creative pass rush from the Rams, aided by their all star hall of fame talent. Burrow was clobbered. They failed to adjust to run the ball & switch to short passes to move the chains until it was too late. 

It’s a pity, because the Bengals looked like they had it but those missteps opened the window just enough for Matt Stafford, one of the most clutch quarterbacks of all time... and Kupp... one of the greatest if not the greatest WR of all time... to snatch victory and their Super Bowl rings along with their place in the history books, when it all looked certain to be slipping away.

Mcvay for as anxious and panicked as he looked on the sideline... he adjusted, adjusted & kept his team fighting. Showing that the scars they gained from the Patriots, weren’t for nothing like with the Falcons... they learned and it made them stronger... and they’ve reached the mountain top. Finally over the hill after betting everything to win. 

It’s bittersweet to see the Amazing story of the Bengals to come to this end, I’ll remember this Super Bowl as them having a chance... but just falling short to a heroic all time effort from Donald, Kupp, and Stafford.",1644808442.0,2,,Football,3,N

In the 44 seasons before the Fords, the franchise had 20 winning seasons and won 4 NFL Championships. In the 58 full seasons of Ford ownership, they've had 15 winning seasons - with 1 (one) playoff victory. They were minority owners 1960-63, and bought the team outright at 11am on November 22, 1963 - 90 minutes before JFK was assassinated.

The overall first pick of the 2009 had a playoff record of 0-3 in Detroit, and ends year one After Detroit at 4-3. Sheila Ford Hamp may be different than her mum or dad. As of right now, she is 8-24-1 as Chairperson, and Matthew Stafford is a World Champion.

The ball flies into the air and connects to the head of Didier Drogba who puts it into the back of the net. Drogba proceeds to run straight towards the camera and rips off his shirt to reveal the words ""I'm coming back baby!"" painted on his chest and he yells ""ONCE A BLUE ALWAYS A BLUE"" at the camera. Then all of a sudden, Jose Mourinho runs up behind Drogba and reveals the same underneath his suit.

The guy was probably involved in 90 percent of all the chances of Bayern. Corners in the first half. Brilliant through ball to Muller in the second half. Constantly finds himself in great positions to score. People hating on him for not passing should watch every Bayern CL match this season and have to find out it's simply untrue.


Still after every chance he misses even every Bayern fan gives him the finger. Then he gives a great assist and there are so many people here writing down extremely cliched responses as: ""wow Robben passes"". Cut this guy some slack. 9 goals and 7 assists in 18 games this season. So many of these were vital assists and goals of him this year in the CL. Maybe even the most important Bayern player this year.


I honestly don't get what he's doing wrong. Ribery gives an elbow, dives, hits players, but that's still a standup guy. Robben plays his heart out, scores the winning goal and gives an assist, but he is obviously the bad guy here...

"**WOW WHAT A COMPLETE GAME.  IT HAD EVERYTHING.**

**General:**  Bayern went to ground faaaaaar too much and I have NO IDEA how Dante didn't get sent off for a 2nd yellow after that foul in the box.  I mean UEFA is all about consistency yet the referees actions rarely follow suit with UEFA's words.  At least Gundogen converted.  It would be a real shame if Dortmund loses so many key players, like they've already lost Gotze.  Such a young, energetic team with potential to become even better than they already are.  Defensively the game was enjoyable to watch (especially the Subotic save), offensively it was fun to see all the chances being created, the energy and the pace.  

**Neuer/Weidenfeller:**  Brilliant game from both of them.  Neuer kept so many, what I thought were inevitable goals, out.  Weidenfeller about the same.  I think the shots Neuer stopped were a tad more difficult but either way they were both spectacular in goal.  Not that anyone would, but I don't think you can really fault either goalkeeper for much of anything in today's match. 

**Robben:**  It's not a popular opinion given all of the comments I read on the match thread and post match thread so far but honestly with all of the 1-on-1 chances, Robben should've netted at least one of them (and he did).

There was a time he was heavily overrated by every hipster in town (he's underrated by them now)

When he's on the right (I hate it when he is) and the defender pushes him out he becomes so helpless with his right foot it's actually pathetic.

"It matters. Rules are rules and the ref officially has no discretion. A called penalty is an automatic yellow, Ribery should have been carded for the dive and the elbow to the face and Lewandowski should have been shown red for stepping on Boateng's ankle at least.

Both challenges vs. Müller were outside of the box btw. but I agree that he should have gotten at least one yellow for that.

It was a great game nonetheless but the refereeing was pretty bad and I hate it that the UEFA always pretends that the rules matter and should be enforced just to give out unofficial recommendations to the refs before important games because they are afraid to offend viewers or affect ratings.

I agree that refs should have the freedom to decide on a situation by situation basis but nothing stops the UEFA from adapting the rules to allow for just that.

As it stands the ref's call was against the rules and people aren't haters just for pointing that out.

If the ref had exercised more control over the game and actually enforced UEFA's rules he would pretty much  have had to send Ribery, Dante and Lewandowski off the pitch for their conduct.

His off the ball movement to create chances and the pace at which he does it, is something I would like on Madrid still.  I don't think we had the most creative year this year.  Most of the creativity comes from Ozil in the middle with Alonso backing him as a playmaker.  Naturally Ronaldo creates plays as well.  On paper, Robben would probably be better for Madrid down the right side with Ronaldo down the left but when it's all said and done, I guess his fitness + recouping some money by selling him was a good enough move.

**Youth level** 

Subotić was part of the squad selected and coached by John Hackworth for the US entry in the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship during September 2005 in Peru. Sixteen years of age at the time, he entered all three group matches as a sub during the final five minutes. In the quarterfinal versus the Netherlands that the US team lost 0–2 and got eliminated, he played from the start, but got red carded in the 73rd minute.

He has also made two appearances for the USA U-20 team. What would prove to be his last one took place in November 2006 in a friendly after which head coach Thomas Rongen criticized Subotić, who had signed for Mainz several months earlier, for ""not accelerating over there to the point where we feel he belongs on the [U.S.] team"". Next summer, Rongen controversially did not select him to play in the 2007 U-20 World Cup in Canada – picking defenders such as Nathan Sturgis, Anthony Wallace, Julian Valentin, Ofori Sarkodie, Tim Ward, and Amaechi Igwe ahead of Subotić – decision that has resulted in Rongen receiving a fair amount of criticism. While Rongen insisted that a groin injury was to blame, there has been considerable speculation since then that Subotić was so stung by Rongen's criticism that he decided to reconsider his international future:

""Well, Rongen certainly said some discouraging and false things about me. Never in my life have I heard that a high level coach publicly criticizes a player. Professional coaches do that one-on-one with the player. I find this disappointing, because a few months later after Rongen said I was not good enough for the U-20s, I played a very good season and started getting calls from various countries [U.S. included] for the full men's team. I still don't know what he saw in the other players, and what he didn't see in me.""


**Full squad** 

Subotić was eligible to represent the United States, Serbia, or Bosnia-Herzegovina.During September 2008, when the issue of his national team eligibility first started getting wider coverage in the football media, playing for Croatia or even Germany were mentioned as possibilities as well, however both options were soon revealed to be media concoctions more than anything else. Bosnia-Herzegovina fell out of the running early as Subotić publicly rejected overtures by the country's football officials and head coach Miroslav Blažević.

By late fall 2008, it became clear that only Serbia figured in his international choice. Citing sources close to Subotić's family, many reports in the Serbian press appeared about his decision to play for Serbia already being made, but waiting for the right moment to state it publicly since he had until 10 December 2009 (his 21st birthday) to declare his choice. In mid December 2008 Subotić informed national team head coach Radomir Antić about his decision to represent Serbia.[4][15] Then in late December 2008, Subotić notified US Soccer Federation about his decision – the first official step in the process of changing national team attachment.

**2010 World Cup qualifying** 

On 28 March 2009, Subotić made his debut for the Serbian national team, in the 2010 World Cup qualifier against Romania in Constanţa that Serbia won 2–3. 

TL;DR: He can't play for the USA since he's cap tied to Serbia, also Thomas Wrongen was an idiot.  That list of reject defenders that got played instead of him is pretty hilarious in retrospect.  Wish Klinsmann had been in charge then.",1369524268.0,2,:r_soccer_user:,Soccer,3,N

> fighting with someone in the club.

People at the club generally like him and there's a reason why he's been our captain in quite a few matches when Lahm and Schweinsteiger were not playing. 

>  Yeah yeah he had a great year

The way you talk about his performance I very much doubt you see him play very often. He's had a stellar season and was probably the best player in the Bundesliga. 

>  I sincerely hope he moves on this summer

Do you even care about Bayern winning? There's no player in the world he couldn't compete with (excluding Ronaldo and Messi as I am sure they aren't human. They just can't be.). He's a very important part of our team and also a great mentor for a lot of young players like Alaba and Shaqiri.

>In the late 1990s Subotić family's residence authorization in Germany expired and in order to avoid being deported back to Bosnia[3] they opted to move to the USA in 1999. They settled in Salt Lake City where Subotić's father had a cousin.[2] Subotić played football with Sparta Gold and Impact Black youth clubs. Within two years the family was on the move again, this time to Bradenton, Florida so that Subotić's sister Natalija could pursue a tennis career at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy.[2] The city also happens to be the base for the United States U-17 national team. Subotić trained on his own in G.T. Bray Park where he got spotted by Keith Fulk, one of the US team's assistant coaches who then informed the team's head coach John Ellinger about Subotić. After arranging a tryout, they offered Subotić a spot in the residency camp. At the time he was not attached to any club sides, but eventually started playing with the University of South Florida team. While playing with the U-17 team in the Netherlands, Subotić was approached by player agent Steve Kelly who inquired about his career plans and offered a possibility of playing in Europe. After impressing at the tryout for 1. FSV Mainz 05, young Subotić was on his way there, initially playing for the club's youth and fourth-division teams (1. FSV Mainz 05 II).[2]

In what kind of a carebare world do you live in? Are you honestly tying morals to success in one's job when he isn't even doing amoral things *while* doing it? It's pretty straight forward with him. You provoke him, he blows up. Is Zidane an asshole? Would you consider Großkreutz an undeserving asshole too then? I wouldn't.  It's part of Ribery's upbringing.

Hmm not all too familiar with the US system but I'm rarely if ever grossed out by German law (as a student of law). I feel my condition (unless the process of coming to the conclusion was bullshit/set up) was enough.

Would you go into a court while practicing and call the judge ""fucking stupid"" after he ruled against you?

> Nice try at dodging the other arguments however. Typical sore loser (of arguments) behavior.

You called me fucking stupid and can't stand that I don't like one of your players. I initially declined to respond because you're being a hypocrite in your statements. You continually call me a sore loser despite having congratulated Munich on victory and simply having a bad opinion of Ribery, yet you have said nothing to indicate you're a good winner.You're sitting here calling people who don't like a court's decision and one of your players fucking stupid.

> If you weren't refering to the underaged thing, were you simply saying that you look down upon him because he consulted a prostitute?

Perhaps because he was married and a practicing Muslim. I respect everyone's beliefs (and unlike you I don't call people fucking stupid for dissenting); I don't like hypocrites.

Ribery's actions on the field are disgusting at times and it's not a one off thing. He acts like an absolute diva and is malicious towards others. Who the player happens to be is irrelevant; I'm disgusted with Lewa for his actions last night--the difference is he hasn't been pulling that type of shit for years on end.",1369596279.0,1,,Soccer,3,N

"OMG Mbappé what was that. Hit that shit with anger boy.

Both teams started nervous, lacking proper passing game. Bayern slowly went past that and started to play their game during the first half, Davies has been exploited by PSG, they made lots of plays on his side as he's clearly nervous.

PSG is focused on counters, and that worked well so far, when in possession they try to make long ball passes to the front three, mostly Mbappé without much success. I understand why the coach would put Ney as a striker, he can be ready to counter Bayern and Mbappé on the left follows Bayern's wide players alongside Bernat.

It was a good 45 min, I'm hoping for PSG to try to pass around Bayern midfield more with shorter passes, that way we can see more of Neymar.

Both teams have obviously studied and prepared. Both sides mostly cancelled out each others offences. Still both sides also had one or two great chances so far.

Overall possession and play is slightly more on Bayerns side. Still the game is very open.

Two big BIG questions will be, a) how either coach adapts their tactics if needed and b) fitness and subs, this has been a very intese play stlye by both sides, how will it play out with tired players is a big question.

"Strange to say, but this CL run by Bayern, at least in some ways, reminded me of the 2014 World Cup and Germany's win. Some obvious similarities include:

\-German sides winning it obviously, with some of the same players between the squads of course.

\-Both Germany and Bayern having exceptional standout performances that will echo through the ages as absolutely unbelievable, utterly destroying what was once considered the ultimate powerhouse of football within a specific era or context. Those results being the 7-1 and the 8-2 of course. Same margins too!

\-Both finals ending 1-0, with the losing side in PSG and Argentina missing huge chances to go ahead earlier and ruing those misses. Also a superstar shattered by the missed chance to go down in history for winning the holy grail for their respective sides, and solidifying their own legacy (Messi and Neymar being the paralleled figures here, of course).

\-Flick being a part of both glorious triumphs, naturally! What a manager he seems to be.

\-The CL itself becoming more like the WC from the quarters onward, with the one-legged ties and the drama that entails. 

There may be even more to the comparison, even though it means little really, and some of it might just be confirmation bias anyway, seeing what I expect and all. Anyway, it's just an interesting parallel to make, but mostly just a fun set of comparisons to contemplate.

Congrats Bayern, up there with Liverpool now with their own number 6, and with this treble done in enthralling fashion now arguably one of the best club seasons ever, and surely up there with their 2013 monster season to boot!

"I call this the German vs Germain Derby.

It was a very entertaining, tactical game... so on-point that the overall flow of the game was very predictable. That tells me that, in hindsight, PSG should've tried something different earlier in the game.

Neuer made great saves but hard to put any Bayern player over others. They all played their role to the letter, including Davies who grew into it after half time.

Most of the great moments from PSG came through Neymar when Kimmich had gone up too far as noted on TV at half-time. Bayern did well to minimize play down that side and only play in Gnabry towards goal rather than get Kimmich involved. Relying on Coman/Davies was not only sufficient but the diagonal passes to Neymar was easily stopped. Biggest moment probably was Mbappe missing that terrible Bayern mistake that nobody expected. Though, it's very likely that it may not have changed the eventual outcome.

The few chances PSG had were inevitable with the talent in their attack but they just couldn't exert any presence in the midfield and after about 30 minutes of exhilarating pace that they couldn't keep up. Eventually, the Bayern press started to become too difficult to handle and the ball was basically given up for the rest of the game.

PSG didn't have too many choices as the bench options looked not quite good enough for this particular game and level, which was clear when the subs did happen. The only thing I thought PSG could do was to switch Neymar and Mbappe around the 70min when it was clear that Neymar is all out of gas. They did do so but much later in the game in hopes that Neymar could create something. Considering possession and the type of scraps PSG had all 2nd half, this should've been done midway through the half. Neymar almost had something for Chupo-Moting at the end after he was more centrally positioned.

Ultimately, the game analysis is all about how PSG could've chased the game cuz Bayern didn't look like they were going to lose even with the chances they gave up because at the very end was Neuer and at the very front was Lewandowski. I just shook my head watching Coman and Gnabry come off for Perisic and Coutinho. Crazy squad.",1598217443.0,31,:Manchester_United:,Soccer,3,N

Loosing to Real again and again was so disappointing tbh. Kovac era begin got knocked out in quarters by pool. Was fourth when Flick took the steering last year.

Having gotten a first half reprieve, it's disappointing that Tuchel didn't sort that shit out. Hope isn't a strategy. When someone's so glaringly outmatched, you have to *at least try* to deal with it tactically or with a sub.

That wasn't the only reason PSG lost. Obviously, Neuer was phenomenal and PSG couldn't even score with their talisman, Marquinhos ""the striker.""

Bayern are just a better and more experienced *team*. The pressing, in particular, was really well executed. Destroyed PSG's deep buildup and choked off the supply lines Mbappe and Neymar. They defended the wings well too. After the goal, PSG couldn't really play on the counter. And it basically became about hoping for a moment individual brilliance to get them back in the game.

Also, watching Neymar crying in the end was fucked up cause they had some really good chances, but in this level you just can't miss.

Now imagine Real Madrid with 3 in a row... What a huge huge achievement.

Ronaldo scoring vs Neuer is a great example of how hard it must be...

I'll be honest, I personally wanted PSG to win because of the trio Neymar, Thiago Silva and Marquinhos (and also for Di Maria, I really like the guy), I was wishing to see Thiago Silva lifting the CL trophy and becoming the biggest idol in the history of the club.

That being said I can't get mad at Bayern winning it, what a team and what a season, probably one of the best teams to win the CL and it was totally deserved.

Great comment. I've never been a big fan of 'false nine' formations. It essentially allows the two centre halves to freely offer all their support to the fullbacks for the wingers' diagonal runs.

Thought both teams started pretty nervy and made basic mistakes,1598235604.0,2,,Soccer,3,N
"PSG changed their style of play and dropped deeper to counter the press.

A high press can only work if the attacking team commit enough players forwards to limit the passing options of the defence. e.g. There is no way for two attackers to successfully  'high press' against a back four + goalkeeper. You need to commit enough attackers to have a 1:1 ratio.

A team can counter the high press by dropping back midfielders to outnumber the pressing team.

Once the team in possession drops players back, the 'pressing team' are disadvantaged because they can be passed around and they have less players behind the ball to defend an attack.

This means that the high press becomes  not only ineffective and high risk but also the pressing players burn off lots of energy doing sprints to close down players who have easy passing options.

But, in terms of tactical disruption, the high press has worked since it has made the opposition team drop deeper in to their own half.

After being pressed for the initial period in tonight's game, the PSG midfield were forced to adapt and came deeper for defensive passes. The keeper also kicked long. Arguably, this was a successful outcome of the Bayern strategy of stopping PSG from building attacks from the back.",1598233864.0,1,:r_soccer_user:,Soccer,3,N

"I think PSG got asphixiated during some parts of the second half. It looks like Tuchel decided the first line (especially Mbappe & Neymar) were only supposed to press in Bayern's half, then stay there if it failed and let the others do the job so they'd be in a good position to receive the ball from them and counter fast.   
But at times, it seemed PSG just could not get one proper pass to the midfield (i.e. Neymar) without getting intercepted by the Bayern's high pressing so Neymar and Mbappe simply had nothing to do. 

It really did not feel that Neymar broke down mentally to me, whenever Neymar received a good pass and the guys around him raced forward, he managed to produce something and create danger, and he kept running to the very end when he had to. He might not have been godlike like in his previous matches, but I felt he was still solid. For the sake of comparison, I felt Mbappe kept overthinking things.",1598371789.0,1,:Olympique_Lyonnais:,Soccer,3,N

Neymar is one of the most skillful players in the game currently. Every team knows this and the way they try to get to him is by going as hard as possible as a mental game. Neymar is aware of this and he’s also aware of the fact that a lot of fouls just don’t get called when you don’t fall even if they would have otherwise been clear. He also seems very worried that he’ll be injured (as he has been) from his opponent way of playing so it’s kind of his protection. To get the foul every time so that the opposing team will either:

A) stack up on yellow cards
B) allow him to play more freely because they’re scared of giving away free kicks / penalties. 

Imo I totally gets why he does it and most of the time it’s clear fouls. He overplays them for sure but he doesn’t seem to fall for no reason much to me.",1598224958.0,33,:r_soccer_user:,Soccer,3,N

De Bruyne going off is a problem because as good as Foden is, he doesn't have that same ability that de Bruyne has to drop out of the midfield to find a bit of space.

"Interesting first half. No, really.

Inter have kept their shape excellently, every defender when they can leaving 5 yards clear in front of themselves to give time and space to watch what City players are doing. Their forwards know what their role is, even dropping back when City's possession lasts longer than a few passes.

This causes City problems because it highlights their lack of pace on the wings. Front and back. Inter's WB's push up because they know Grealish/Bernardo ain't tracking back nor pulling away with speed on a counter.

Haaland is isolated then because he is the only pace City have in the team, and Inter's midfield are shutting that shit down. Can't remember the last time I've seen Gundogan sit so deep.

So, interesting. Pep's the one needing to change something here. Inzaghi will happily do this for the rest of the game.",1686426878.0,13,,Soccer,2,N

I won't lie I only tried to pay attention to the positions/space of the players for around 60'ish minutes before praying for the Lakaka memes to come true. However... 

I thought Inter did fantastic and were one of the few teams this season to give City a real fight.(especially defensively) City interestingly this time went for a back 3 with ONE PIVOT in Rodri. Stones/Gundogan occupied the  LCM/RCM with De Bruyne occupying the CAM position. They probably went with this shape because man to man Inter defended with 2 up top / 3 in the midfield outnumbering the usual double pivot formation City have had this season. 

City defended with 4 uptop and constantly pressured the 3 Inter defenders. However Onana was fantastic and was amazing at his feet. Constantly finding long balls to distribute away from that press/find the Wingbacks. Lukaku especially was amazing at receiving long balls to cushion for his teammates, creating chance after chance. (Don't ever let anybody say Lukaku played bad this game, he was phenomenal and created chaos in the City back line) Just unlucky in the end. 

MVP should go to Ederson just for keeping City alive in the end lol. City were a fun team to watch this season, and looking at it from a pure footballing perspective deserved this UCL. Pep finally found the solutions to his problems, constantly tinkering and experimenting. Whether its anything in life that type of forward thinking will yield you something new. New tactics for attacking/ defending.... exploiting specific areas of the field... finding overloads, etc. It's why he is one of the greatest managers in football.",1686460552.0,3,,Soccer,3,N

I have no doubt this win will do exactly what the City brass/ownership want, which is give clout and legitimacy to the club in the eyes of kids, teenagers, and generally anyone under 20. They can't buy our opinions but be damn sure they can buy the support of especially international supporters who don't understand the harm being done. Our last hope is the rules violations in England, but if we're truly being honest with ourselves the FA and other governing bodies simply do not have the resources to take on an entire nation state. It's a shame because 15 years ago everyone was condemning Chelsea for the financially juiced club they were, yet City took that model into the stratosphere. And here we are. I won't be surprised if in 10 years only City, Newcastle, RM and PSG are the only clubs capable of winning a European Cup. And I won't be surprised when, outside of the oil clubs, youth engagement with football falls off a cliff and the game moves from community staple to the franchise, only wealthy allowed model we have in the US.

So when teams don’t mark Haaland, he scores. When they don’t double team Bernardo/Mahrez or Grealish/Foden they create or score. And if they don’t close down the edge of the box in front of goal, then KDB/Rodri/Gundo score.

"
> City's goal came from the one moment in the game where there was no Inter player to immediately close down the City player.

That's just what you can do when you have some of the very best midfielders in the sport. Rodri, Gundogan, Bernardo, De Bruyne, they can all take that shot and they need only one chance (Gundogan Vs Man Utd got two...). Even Stones is starting to take those shots - not well yet, but who knows. And then these guys rotate positions with the likes of Foden, Grealish, and Mahrez - keeping all of them starved of space is a very hard job.

I think Old Pep has started to embrace the idea that not everything can be set up as a tactic, not every game is won on the whiteboard - you need a solid plan and a good idea of how players should link up, but there is something that you cannot predict, something for which you just need great players. 10 years ago he wouldn't have bought a Haaland, maybe not even 5 years ago...

They didn't say greatest story in THIS CLUBS' football history .

"Rangers have no proper quadruples.  They include the glasgow cup and cup only played between celtic and rangers. It wasn't a major trophy .They have 7 trebles.  Not one of their trebles was a European treble. 

The page you sent literally says Barcelona and bayern never won a sextuple. Literally has them as quadruples as they weren't in the same season.  

And only one of their quadruples was done with 4 most prestigious trophys available to them .. 

Celtic have 1 quadruple.  When they won the European cup, The League, The FA Cup and The league Cup. 

Literally click on 5 titles in one season and tell me if it has bayern or barca there? It does not. It has celtic

Not click on 6 titles in one season and tell me if it has bayern or barca there?  It does not.  

Celtics European Quadruple with all homegrown players  (or quintuple if you count mickey mouse trophys) is a greater story than both bayern and barcas quadruples, bayerns was more impressive than barcas as it was a euro quad.  . They never done a sextuple as evidenced by the wiki page you sent.

For Bayern or Barca to do a Sextuple they would need to first win the UCL or Europa League in season 1.  This would get them Super cup for season 2. 

They would have to win their league or domestic cup in season 1 also.  This would qualify them for their domestic super cup in season 2

Now in season one they've won a double minimum. 
Now season 2 is where they can win a Sextuple. 

They would have to win Euro super cup, Domestic Super cup, domestic cup , league, Champions league in season 2 for it to be a Sextuple. ( If they win the Club world cup in this season also, its a whatever the feck a seventuple is)


 It has to be in one season, as evidenced by the wiki page you sent.",1686492716.0,1,:Celtic:,Soccer,3,N
