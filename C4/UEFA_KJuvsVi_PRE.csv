"Juve is IMHO playing good and yet can't shake the feeling they are going to get fucked. This is why imho Villarreal was a way worse matchup for them than Sporting which they drew the first time.

Hopefully they win, as fun as it would be to watch them lose I'd rather have them distracted at least for another month and it would be sad if every Italian team went out instantly.",1647465001.0,5,:transpride::Napoli:
