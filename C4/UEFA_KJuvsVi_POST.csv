Villareal in the first half, always in the match always.

  
Second half, Emery mixed it up. Gave Juve the ball and let Juve set the tempo. Juve, next to never was finding the free man between the lines. Looked like Juve in that second half could have played another 90 minutes without conceding and they would never score. Villareal always looked more in their toes when attacking in the second half, more bright because they were covering the ground very well while defending, saving their energies. The pen comes with those between the lines movements and the right changes at the right time.Tactically wise, fully deserved from Villareal, they didn't take anything they didn't deserve from today's match.

Today though, while we weren't anything crazy compared to actual strong teams, for sure, we tried to play actual football for once and we would've deserved the win.

First of all there have been some favourable calls for Inter. Torino, for example, should have had a penalty for sure.

The Sanchez call was the correct call. He was already on a yellow card, and the tackle, with studs showing deserved a yellow card as well.

Unlike you, I'm perfectly capable of leaving bias behind and think somewhat logically.

However, there was no ""robbery"" or favourable call against Juve in the super Cup.

There was no robbery against Juve tonight. There was no 100% penalty for Juve, there was no dive that was called a penalty. And you deserved to lose. End of story.
