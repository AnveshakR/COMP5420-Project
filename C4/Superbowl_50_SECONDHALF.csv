"UPDATE: (SHOULD BE FINAL UPDATE):

So this is what my brother told me what happened in regards to the beer and food fight. Basically, he was sitting like 5 or 6 rows up from them and one person threw a beer like 3 rows ahead of him and it hit a Broncos fan. This seemed planned because the Broncos fan had nachos and beer that he immediately threw at him and then grabbed another beer and threw that. 

In what seemed like seconds later, multiple people in the section began throwing food and beer everywhere. My brother was safe from the damage, no beer made it up to his row. He took out his phone to record and he said he will send me the recording after the game. 

Security came down and started grabbing people. It started with 3 or 4 people on the aisles getting grabbed but then more security came and locked down the section. People started getting grabbed out of nowhere and people started booing (don't know if they were booing the security or the foodfighters). 

Everything calmed down after about 15 minutes, but security was incredibly tight after that and the section was a emptier, which is nice. 

All in all, the most expensive food fight could be considered a success by some, I guess. ",1454898955.0,7,
