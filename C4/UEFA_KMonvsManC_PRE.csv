The other 50% is allocated as follows 'the amount representing the value of each market will be paid in proportion to the number of matches played by each club in the 2016/17 UEFA Champions League.

Each time that a club from an association represented by one or more clubs in the UEFA Champions League group stage is eliminated in the play-offs, 10% of that association's market pool share will be deducted and allocated to the eliminated club.

"Well, I know very well about home advantage, and I love that the away rule exist. It's one of the smartest things implemented in football IMO. Even tho it has no impact on any of the games (unless Monaco only wins 2-0 or City manage to pull some back) 

But yea, having the home match in the return leg seems to be a favorable thing.

Still, it's very interesting that 4 of 8 fixtures (potentially) can be turned around. If Monaco wins, 3 of them will be suprising (Leicester beating Sevilla, Monaco beating a City with 2 goal lead, and Barca coming back after 4-0. Dortmund not suprised at all)",1489611620.0,1,

"I think whenever you talk about a promising winger you have to imagine that player without any pace. What qualities does he have that justify a place in a top team, disregarding his pace? Bale's shooting and crossing is immense. From wide positions some of the best crossing in the game right now. Immense pace and spin. And just look at his free-kicks. He clearly knows how to hit a football. Reus is exactly the same. Passing, shooting he could do very well as a CAM. Bernardo Silva, his technique is amazing. Ball always close to his body, great vision. What does Sterling have? Obviously he knows how to finish once it's a 1 on 1. But other than that? Everything he does is with his pace. That's nice when you are playing on the counter, but fairly useless otherwise. I suppose you could use that hypothetical ""no-pace"" situation for any player. It will become very clear which player actually has any footballing qualities. As a weapon in the arsenal it's fine, not if that's one of your few redeeming qualities.",1489610240.0,3,:AC_Milan:
