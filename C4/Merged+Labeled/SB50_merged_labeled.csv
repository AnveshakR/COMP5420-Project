Come 6:30 EST, I will be an enemy. I will scream, I will curse Peyton Manning's name, I will wish dreadful harm every time Denver gets a first down, and I will probably rub it in your collective faces when we score. 

But for now, I still have some decency left. And I want to be a good sport. The Broncos are my second favorite team, and if they were playing anyone but the Panthers, I'd be rooting for you. So let's watch it all play out. Manning's last ride vs Newton's first. Super Bowl 50, with the two best teams in the league going head to head. Whatever happens over the next few hours, let's just agree that it should be a good one, and let's all hope that is one for the legends decades down the line.

As a Raider fan living in Denver, I've seen every snap of every Broncos game this season.

They had 12 close calls and they converted 11 of them. Good enough for home field.

Got to the Super Bowl and dominated an ill-prepared and ill-equipped Panthers team.

If you don't believe in sports gods, here you go. They were ONE slip up away from going to Cincy and New England in the playoffs, and never once caught the bad end of the stick. A defense can only go so far until you realize that, when you convert that many, it's just destiny.

"I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I'm happy that Peyton Manning went out (likely) on a high note, cementing his place as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, though this win was no doubt helped by the amazing Broncos defense, which was the cause that led Manning to the Super Bowl in the first place. It's like how I felt for Ray Lewis in Super Bowl XLVII.

However, I also feel like Cam Newton and the Panthers' stellar season effectively means nothing now. I mean, they *did* lose the Super Bowl, which I had hoped would give me more competition than it did. But nothing, I feel, also applies to their reputation, especially Cam Newton's. Before the season started, it seemed that Carolina was stuck in a rut, with Newton just a flashy but mediocre quarterback. With this loss, it seems as though all the games Carolina won to toss away that image of theirs has reformed, and they'll have to start over. I know that Newton will win a Super Bowl. He has both the offense *and* the defense to get there. But it feels like this season did very little to improve their overall standing, what with their loss tonight.",1454902938.0,7,:NFL: NFL,Football,3,N

But the fumbles and the ineffective offenses were way more about the offensive lines getting eaten alive by dominant defensive stars. I know the Super Bowl attracts a lot of casual fans, and casual fans like offense. But it's ok to have defensive slugfests too. It's ok for offenses to get carried by their defenses at times, especially when QBs like Manning and Newton have carried their teams to wins so many times before. I thought both QBs played pretty decent considering they were up against two of the best defenses in the league.

"That Denver defense is incredible. Wade Phillips is incredible. My original prediction was 24-17 Carolina. The closer it got to game time though, the more I thought Denver would win a close one. I changed it to 23-20 Denver. No way would I have predicted a two possession victory though.

A few things:

First, what an incredible come back story for Peyton. I am so happy for him. Not only within this season, but to come back from those surgeries and have a spectacular season and then get another championship. Wow.

Second, Cam's pocket awareness is awful. It always has been, but his athleticism gets him out of it. He will improve this though, and he will be a top QB in this league for a long time. Carolina isn't going anywhere. He and Russell could very well be the next great QB rivalry.

Third, I know 4th and 24 from your own 3 is an extreme long shot. However, you can't punt there. You just can't. There's 2 minutes left and it's a 2 possession game. Punting there is sealing the victory for Denver. That means the best case scenario is you take over around your 20 yard line with 40 seconds left still down 14. Now though, you have no timeouts.",1454916085.0,4,:Chiefs: Chiefs,Football,3,N

"UPDATE: (SHOULD BE FINAL UPDATE):

So this is what my brother told me what happened in regards to the beer and food fight. Basically, he was sitting like 5 or 6 rows up from them and one person threw a beer like 3 rows ahead of him and it hit a Broncos fan. This seemed planned because the Broncos fan had nachos and beer that he immediately threw at him and then grabbed another beer and threw that. 

In what seemed like seconds later, multiple people in the section began throwing food and beer everywhere. My brother was safe from the damage, no beer made it up to his row. He took out his phone to record and he said he will send me the recording after the game. 

Security came down and started grabbing people. It started with 3 or 4 people on the aisles getting grabbed but then more security came and locked down the section. People started getting grabbed out of nowhere and people started booing (don't know if they were booing the security or the foodfighters). 

Everything calmed down after about 15 minutes, but security was incredibly tight after that and the section was a emptier, which is nice. 

All in all, the most expensive food fight could be considered a success by some, I guess. ",1454898955.0,7,,Football,2,N
