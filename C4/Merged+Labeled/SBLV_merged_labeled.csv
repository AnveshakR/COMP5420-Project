"Tom Brady is the best quarterback of all time. Period. End of story.

Any super bowl he wins after this just continues to emphasize the fact that the dude is the goat. Period.

There is no argument, there is no but but but.. it just is.

Realize this. I cannot wait for his induction speech into the Hall Of Fame where he belongs. They've been dusting and moving shit around in canton for years now, maybe decades, to make room for his statue. its probably going to be a huge ass bust of his cock with 7 or more super bowl rings on it.

Dude is just the man. Gets it done. people give up vast amounts of cash etc just to have the chance to play for him.

LFG is his motto and he continues to get it fucking done. Hate the patriots, hate the bucs, hate tom or bill.. but one thing is for sure. Tom Brady just wins and is the best quarterback ever to play the game, and ever that we have all seen.

I doubt his run or career or anything he has done will ever be eclipsed. It just doesn't happen.. ever. But yet, Tom got it done.

Being a cowboys fan and remembering what its like to see a team be so dominant.. Brady is on that level but even more so. Ive watched football and been a fan since i was born bascially. Ive seen the cowboys dominate football and do things no other team has.. until now. The team he plays on will always be a contender, and the guy just motivates and must be a fucking alien or something because he just finds, wills, performs, or does whatever it takes to win ever game he can, and every super bowl he shows up in.

7 out of 10 is just.. unimaginable. Many players.. more than 75% or more never even sniff the super bowl.. and this guy... the guy that should have the biggest bust in canton.. has been to TEN fucking super bowls and won 7 of them.

Incredible. The absolute Everest of the sport. We as fans will never see anything like this again as fans, in any sport.

So realize that and remember that you where here and now when brady won his 7th super bowl out of ten.

Its just that insane to think hes been to 10. Won 7. I could ride his nuts for life as will so many other sports or NFL fans.

How could you not? In amazing fashion and with the utmost respect of players far and wide, globally, locally.. hell i bet creatures from other galaxies and solar systems or whatever.. know about Tom fucking Brady.

AS much as I want to see the cowboys win.. as a fan of the NFL and a fan of football in general.. its absolutely impossible to recognize true talent, leadership, and excellence at his position when you talk about quarterbacks and love/drive/heart/ and will to win each and every game the guy plays in. Regardless of its importance or factor in the season or super bowl.

If you're not recording everything that's happened in this game and every game he has played in at this level in order to remember these moments for you, your son or daughter to relive through your eyes and your head to really realize, you're missing out.

None of us will ever see something this great in the NFL in our lifetimes. Record it, remember it, and pass it on to your grandchildren and their children.

It will not happen again. It never happened before, and after his run is done, it wont happen again unless some team hits the lottery in the fucking 6th round and that guy happens to be a kid who watched tom brady growing up. but it just doesn't happen and as much as id like to see it happen again to dak and the cowboys.. i just think it wont happen again because of how special and straight up one in a trillion chance that things had to occur and happen for this type of dominance and excellence took place in the body of one human being and every team he was on.

It just doesn't happen, and if it does, it happens once in a lifetime so everyone realize and take notes on what going down..

Tom Brady is the GOAT. its not even up for debate or argument. The line used to be 5 championships.. and this guy pressed the line out to 7 championships out of 10.

Just, the GOAT. Now, and Forever. Congrats Tom Brady, you truly are the best we have ever seen and will ever see.",1612757669.0,13,:Cowboys: Cowboys,Football,3,N

"And just think next year their playing in SoFi stadium. Maybe stafford and the rams will make an appearance if they can best brady and company.

Lots of big ifs though in that statement. Brady looks as good as ever. The laser he threw to GronK for the 2nd touchdown looked like he was 23 not 43.

Dude is ballin, and always has been ballin. Anyone who bets against Brady aint got the best W/L ratio thats for sure.

I learned a long time ago on football office pools to not bet against the guy. If i picked against him on the weekly pool i usually lost so i always bet with him after a few losses. 

One things for sure, the guy gets it done. Gronk got some TD's, even antonio brown made a cameo and got a TD.

If the bucs find a way to lose this, itd be like the Falcons Pats game in reverse. I think brady is well on his way to another lombardi.. but i never count mahomes out. Dude always shows up in the 3rd and 4th quarters with him and his team's back against the wall. Hell the guy has less than 10(TEN) flippin career losses.

As a coach of the Bucs, id definitely let the team know that we might as well be tied or losing.. and to play that way. If anyone can bring a team back on the verge of getting a huge loss and getting their asses kicked.. its Patrick Mahomeboy. 

Should be a great 2nd half.

And the weekend dropping 7 million bucks for that half time show was dissapointing.

Still, the best halftime show ever was Prince in the rain.. followed closely by Justin Timberlake grabbin some TiTTaY's",1612749078.0,2,:Cowboys: Cowboys,Football,3,N

"It's interesting that people are already putting Rings on Mahomes finger.  I haven't seen many people talk about how he will end with less than 4 or even 3.  I will say this.  If he loses this superbowl and you give me his over/under total rings at 4.5 I will take the under all day.  

Mahomes is really really good.  But since the salary cap era there has only been 1 QB who has won more than 2 Rings.  I appreciate what Mahomes has done as much as anyone.  He is going to be a top 10 and probably top 5 QB of all time when it is said and done as long as he stays healthy.  So far he has been paid 3.7M, 4.5M and 5.3M in his first 3 seasons playing.  Once he is paid something like 40M that will take 2 star players off his team that he has had for these runs.  

Right now he has the best dynamic duo in NFL history on his team in Kelce and Hill. Kelce isn't getting any younger and Hill is right now being under paid at 18M/yr.  What happens when the price tag for Hill jumps up to 24M/yr and Kelce starts to decline?
