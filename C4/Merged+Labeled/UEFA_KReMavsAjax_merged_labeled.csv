"Regarding the VAR decision.  Contrary to what the announcers said there being green between the ball and the line does not necessarily make it out of bounds.  The ball has to be completely over the line meaning that if you drew a line straight up into the air from the line if any part of that line was touching any part of the ball it is still in.  So the very bottom of the ball might be touching past the line but another point on the ball not touching the ground still could be over the line making it still in.

I couldn't tell if it was still in or not but the announcers don't help the situation by mis-explaining the rules and spreading ignorance by claiming that if there is green between the line and the part of the ball touching the ground it must be out as this is not what the laws of the game say.",1551821670.0,73,:Chelsea:,Soccer,2,N

"Ramos taking a yellow to rest is epitome of what is wrong with Real Madrid this season. We underestimate opposition time and time again, never learning a lesson. How do you look at the previous match and go GG EZ this is gonna be a walk in the park at the Bernabeu let me take a day off. 

Worst thing is we keep getting away with it and we don't learn so as much as I want them to win, this finally might be a wake up call for the team. It feels like they lost all motivation to win anything. Ajax is just simply a much hungrier team running their ass off and winning every 50/50 ball while we leave players wide open walking back to defend.

Vinny is our best player because outside of few select others he seems like the only player that even cares.",1551819208.0,11,:Real_Madrid:,Soccer,2,4F

A little bit of luck was needed in Bale's chance but sometimes fortune favours the bold. 

Real doesn't really show anything similar to being  cohesive unit in the back and most of the chances came from either individual moves or from the wings, not much to see through the middle.

Madrid's defense makes it way too easy for Ziyech and Co. to ping through balls into unbelievably big spaces between their defenders.

"Ajax were absolutely brave to start the game today, they committed so many bodies forward (which might be a bit of confidence with Ramos being out) and it allowed them to break quickly and always leave themselves at least in an even numbered break, but how quickly they moved the ball really helped. Every ball from Ajax was direct and helped them transition after the pressure. 

The midfield shape from Madrid was shocking. Ajax broke quickly but you were often left with Modric as the only midfielder back to defend and he hasn’t really got the legs to cover all that ground. The commentators kept highlighting young vs old which is a fair point, but Solari has also ran this side into the ground, they’re not the strongest this season but you can’t use the same team in 2 games against Barcelona and then against a high pressing Ajax side. The injuries weren’t really surprising with 3 high intensity games in a row and then Vinicius being relied upon so much this season. Obviously Solari won’t be the permanent manager and it is a bit of a write off season but the lack of rotation really is criminal

Ajax completely overran the midfield and they didn’t really play with much width at all with Ziyech and Schone coming in to support the midfield. I think that was so clever to feel they could overrun the midfield with the games that midfield 3 played previously. Tadic was also excellent in helping with that when dropping deep to link up.",1551822839.0,145,:c_Liverpool:,Soccer,3,N

But I thought I should share my thoughts about this team from the perspective of a guy who just loves football.

It’s just lovely to watch this team succeed.
Not only for the action on the pitch, but also for another fact.

This is a team that has a core identity, built on its tradition of developing young talents and a great history of Dutch players.

It’s not that I hate on other teams spending huge amounts on this insane transfer market.
And we all know this Team won’t be the same next year, it’s just the Reality of modern Football.

But it would have been fun to watch this team grow into something even bigger.
Even from my perspective as a Bayern supporter it would just been so cool to see more teams building up their identity and their strengths just like this Ajax Team, instead of seeing the young top talents all at the same 4-6 teams.

Just my two cents.....

Also 
Congrats to all Ajax supporters!

No motivation
No system
Creativity in final third is non existant
Defense lacks organization
The press is inefficient and leaves us exposed

Bale looked shaken from all the media talk. With a better coach this could’ve been avoided. Solari has isolated some of our best past performers and the only positive is that he has trusted the youth. He has brought nothing tactically. This team needs someone like Simeone that will scare, motivate and organize them. 

Kroos was terrible. It may be time to replace him with someone younger and more dynamic. 

Real just forced the ball forward to Vini and the boy is just not ready for that kind of role.

Benzema looked good but really lacks flair for goal. He should’ve scored a few goals in these past few games.

Flo will probably go crazy this summer and if not, then he will become the target.

I don’t know what to say, this performance was just disgraceful. Players who have lifted everything you can lift in football like Kroos, Casemiro, Carvajal and Varane were completely invisible. Didn’t even show the desire to win, which to me is the most painful thing about all of this. I want to thank Asensio, Reguilon and Modric for their effort, they were only ones today worthy of wearing the jersey. 


As much as I will get flamed for saying this, I hope that most of the Champions League winning team gets sold. Varane, Carvajal, Kroos, Casemiro, Benzema, Bale. None of them have the hunger necessary anymore at a club like Real Madrid. Add Courtois to this too, absolute waste of money. We should have just used Navas for this last year and then tried to go for De Gea. It is time for a new era, with a new coach. Solari looked like he fixed the situation in February, a month later and we’re knocked out of every competition in the first week of March. You could fire him so a new coach could use the remainder of the season as a build up for the next, but I’m not even sure if that will fix the situation. 


La Liga for now should be used for the development of the new squad. Bench everyone apart from Modric, Reguilon and Asensio. I want to see plenty of playing time for Vini, Llorente, Brahim Diaz, Odriozola, Ceballos, Vallejo and Valverde. In the summer Perez needs to splash cash like it’s 2009, we need hungry superstars and world class talents to recover. Hazard, Eriksen, Jovic, Koulibaly, Militao, apart from Icardi I don’t care who it is as long as they are willing to give everything for the jersey.

For every fan who refuses to move on from the core (Modric/Kroos/Bale/Navas/Benz/Marcelo) just because they won a lot for us in the past but have been either inconsistent or just plain bad the last 2 seasons. 

We are Real Madrid, players come to win, not retire. Our goal is to have the best team in the world, not hold on to players past their prime. Bad form happens in stretches of a month or so, not a season or two, and the fact of the matter is our players have declined and they just don't fit together anymore and I'm not sure what is more infuriating. The fact that we have fans who don't get this or how fucking dreadful we have been this season and last, even with our fluke CL title last season.

There is literally no evidence to suggest we have any player who is the best at their position. 
Modric is good but he's also old and can me rather inconsistent.  
Kroos is unmotivated and hasn't been consistent in 2 years.  

The midfield needs a major revamp because it just doesn't work

Bale is not only past his prime but also doesn't do shit when he plays and should be here, we should eat whatever funds we have to just to sell him. 

Nacho was Mr reliable for years but there is no discussion on how poor he has been and that we can do well to sell him and Vallejo. 

Marcelo is no longer the player he once was and his time is at an end as well
 
There are so many issues with our team simply because we got complacent and chose to not make changes that we started to value club legends retiring with us than actually winning titles and it's sickening. We had Ronaldo last season and still lost the league by 20 points and some people have the audacity to simply think we need a finisher to solve all of our problems. No, we need a new damn midfield, a new right wing, new depth in our defense, as well as a new system because our core that won all those CL titles have been dire both this season and last and quite simply just isn't good enough anymore. It doesn't work anymore and it's time for people to wake up to this ",1551823444.0,3,:Real_Madrid:,Soccer,3,4F

"[double posting to give it max exposure]

Look, I didn't see the game today and it got spoiled before I could see it...

In many ways, today and, in a broader sense, this past week, are maybe the best thing that could've happened to Real Madrid, in the long run. As twisted as this will sound (which is very, very twisted, but bear with me on it), maybe the worst thing that could've happened this year would've been Real Madrid, somehow and inexplicably, finding a way to win the Champions League this year. It could've led Perez into thinking that Real Madrid was still good enough and not in need of major overhaul. Don't believe me? They only finished 17 points behind Barcelona last season and downgraded their roster over the summer mercato.

No, getting pants'd by Barcelona (if not in performance than on the scoreboard anyway) twice, at home, and then getting blown off their own field at the Bernabeu against, you know, ""some Dutch team"" (surely that's how many people will perceive Ajax, however wrong they are to do so) is a very good nutshell of what the last 1.5 seasons have been like at the Bernabeu, more-or-less. Real Madrid looking second rate and performing well below expected standard.

There will be an expectation for overhaul now. They need it. Their professionalism is atrocious. The roster isn't good enough. The coaching is disastrous. They need a full-scale, high-level pressure washing of that entire club. Crashing out of three competitions in the space of seven days, with all three losses coming at home? That will do it. Surely that will do it.

Finish in the top-4 and overhaul the club. Today was a long-time coming and Real Madrid badly needed this. Up to them now to take heed and act accordingly.",1551838708.0,4,:Internazionale:,Soccer,3,N

Do you guys think there will be a better pairing? The only two I would consider is Kroos and Modric. I know their form is off but they have been class for so long and Modric is reigning Ballon d'or.

This hurts a lot and its easy to just blame certain players or the manager but for me, this all comes down to Florentino's idiocracy.

By choosing certin managers and neglecting to buy the players the team needs this is all on florintino not the players or the manager. It's not like solari is a incredibly profound manager that has countless trophies in his cabinet so we can easily shift the blame to him, it's his first time in this situation and his lack of experience clearly showed throughout his time here. Also most of the players don't deserve the blame either this same group apart from a couple of players has won 4 champions leagues in the past 5 years, they know what to do and how to get it done but its just time for a change we all know there would be a downfall, I just hope we can enjoy watching this squad play together the rest of the season and the rebuilding process can begin in the summer because if not then it will be just like Pre CR7 era where we kept getting knocked out every year in the round of 16.",1551824217.0,2,,Soccer,3,N

"This game just exemplified why I don't understand the Madrid fans who wanted Solari to stay.

Against a well performing side his team crumbles. He has no clear idea of how he wants the team to play. I wouldn't be surprised if his instructions when it comes to attacking football boil down to *""Score goals or something.""*.

They're dangerous over lucky crosses which is not surprising considering the amount of times they just punt the ball into the box. One of those ball's going to find one of their teammates.

When it's not a cross it's the usual flash of individual brilliance by someone like Vinicius, Bale or Benzema. When it comes to actually moving the ball around in a clever manner they're absolutely clueless.

Their is no clear style of play he employs. Neither Madrid's attack nor their defense has been dominant under him. I do however blame Florentino Perez moreso than him. Who promotes a manager struggling with the Castilla to the first team?

He gained some love from the fans by bringing the usual Simeone/Gattuso-esque quotes about Cojones and all of that crap. 

Ajax' display was fantastic today. I felt like compared to the first leg it was a slightly more conservative approach with the only difference being their lethality, which was more than enough because they were already the far superior side at home.

Their relative strength should come as no surprise as they drew both matches against Bayern in the group stage and looked like the better team in both matches.  
Madrid on the other hand look overplayed and worn out. They put a lot of energy into both matches against Barcelona and when Ajax scored early they just didn't have it in them to come back into the match.  
All great teams have an era and eventually their reign ends. It simply was Madrid's time to realize that time waits for nobody.

"Before this era began, Real lost a knockout tie to another young side in the 2012-13 season, albeit in the semi-finals, the third season on the trot. That young Dortmund side was similar to this Ajax side. Played dauntlessly, pressed high, and gave everything they had. We lost 4-1 to them away with Lewa, Reus and Gotze running us ragged. But when they came to the Bernabeu, we made sure they were scared. Won 2-0 on the night and lost 4-3 on aggregate, had plenty of chances to score the all important last goal to win. But we went out without shame. The players had given everything. For the badge, for the Bernabeu, for the pride of Real Madrid. The next season, we won the Decima. 

Today was different. You'd expect they'd learn something about young teams who were technically brilliant, tactically well set up, and driven by once in a generation talent for the said club. But no, had a lead in the first leg that simply succumbed to the press within the first few minutes. Players accepted defeat before the final whistle blew, heck, even way before that; letting Ajax prance around the Bernabeu like they owned it. No urgency, no plan. Just starting the game like they'd automatically qualify and not knowing how to react like champions usually do when the going got tough. Modric's inability to shoot probably summed up what went missing through that loss 6 years ago to now. 

No matter we win, or lose, or tie; We're all Real Madrid till we die. But at least play like you're playing for it man.

Casemiro loses the ball too easily under pressure I hope Llorente can dethrone him soon. Nacho was shit for the 3rd goal, gave Tadic all the space to shoot instead of closing him down. Ramos would have been all over him.
Left side looked good but Vinicius injury was unfortunate. We need more defensive stability and more attacking threat, a formation change is necessary I feel, the gap between the lines is too much for teams to exploit easily. 
Ajax ofcourse have unbelievable talent in their team and unless Papa Flo realizes that the team needs reinforces asap, I fear we will have to see few seasons of relative mediocrity from us. 
A bit unfortunate to hit the post twice, Bale was good but not clinical enough. Few players have just not been upto the level of Real Madrid while the young players on whom we counted have not shown they are good enough except Reguilon and Vinicius. Bernabeu has also disappointed with the support and the squad is simply lacking the drive. New players in defense, mid and strikers are needed to light a fire under the players.",1551823293.0,1,,Soccer,3,N

"A complete disaster, reminded me of the feelings I got when RM lost the league race in 2014 or the CL exit in 2012 with Bayern, like being empty inside, especially the third goal.

Anyway, this is how football goes, can't always win, in fact even the best squads suffer a lot more failures than successes. In some level there was a hideous beauty on what transpired on the pitch; there is no room for nonsense in elite level football, you've got to perform, show constantly that you are better, otherwise nothing can save you. This year's RM was severely underwhelming in all levels (administration, coaching, roster) and as a result failed completely.

Congratulation to Ajax who grabbed this unique chance by the hair and triumphed putting on a great performance. I would have applauded them if I was on the stands and it's a shame they have shrunk so much as a club that they'll probably lose a bunch of key figures. Tadic especially put on a masterclass, even Messi could be jealous of that.

Not in the mood to analyse RM's performance. In the days leading up to the game I thought Casemiro's performance would be crucial, that RM's best chance was defending the first leg's result and if Ajax scored 1-2 goals and RM had to compete in which squad was more capable in scoring goals ...shit. To some degree an extraordinary number of things went wrong but anyway that's the nature of knock out games, you've got to constantly be much better than your opponents, otherwise you ain't going far. Still, the fact that Solari didn't rotate recently although it was clear that today's game was the crucial one leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.

The hope is that all these failures won't be swept under the rug and this season's mistakes will work as lessons for the future. Hopefully, plenty of faces got their last chances and the time for changes is nigh.

So funny the amount of time the spent deciding whether or not to take away the 3rd goal.

Same tactical problems that were present in the first game and the games against Barca. Attack and midfield is split with half of them running back and the other half pressing. De Jong was getting deep to collect the ball and modric tried to press (which almost is impossible) him leaving all kinds of space behind. Tadic walks out to midfield to draw one of the defenders out just like Suarez did and vdBeek and Neres could could use their depth to exploit Varane and Nacho (also their weakest qualities) and the backs in behind.,1551823931.0,30,,Soccer,3,N

"Being not motivated to play in the UCL(if it is the case) is more on the coach than the players. It's honestly a case of having a bad coach to me. There really is essentially no position on the field where Ajax have a better player than you do. 

For instance, it's a shame to see Madrid finding it hard to progress the ball further up the pitch through quick passes like Ajax when being pressed at home. This didn't seem to be too much of a problem when you were pitted against Klopp's gegenpress for example. This is on the coach. What were Madrid's ways of getting goals today? Working the ball in the flanks and creating crossing opportunity in such a slow way that Ajax have six men well positioned? There are so many other things taht I could point out.

When it comes to blaming players - okay Kroos had a bad game. He also provided the best pass of the game which Bale hit the upright from. He does his job circulating the ball but nothing happens from the flanks. What is he supposed to do when he gets the ball but doesn't see too much movement ahead of him. What is he supposed to do if there isn't decent combination play like he could with Marcelo and Ronaldo under Zidane? Despite all this, it was a poor performance from him. But if all the players played bad, the issues run deeper.",1551824540.0,1,,Soccer,3,N

You should know that at least one of those victories is totally unjust, because of heavy referee help, and because Ramos commits vicious fouls to get ahead, injuring key players. Ronaldo and Zidane both left after the previous season ended, some say Zidane knew Madrid was a sinking ship. 

Ramos is the main defender + captain of Madrid, he started I think in 2005. In the previous game with Ajax he intentionally went for a foul that will disqualify him from yesterday's game, because it means that he will definitely not miss the NEXT game (should Madrid qualify yesterday).

The only games in which I saw a Real Madrid that I want to see were against Barca in the Copa, and against Atleti, Betis, and Sevilla in La Liga. So it seems that they can only motivate themselves against the best opponents, when domestic leagues are generally won against the smaller sides. 


On Kroos I would agree with you if this game was an exception, however he has been extremely poor for this entire season and looks like a shadow of himself right now.

"> They still have the cups in the cabinet 

And they will have them from now on, but again, having Cups in a Cabinet DO NOT GARANTEE ANYTHING. This isn't the 50's with Franco and terror regimes and whatnot. This is not that era, it's a time where you win in the field, playing, where people don't cower in front of history, they would rather rewrite it, as Ajax did. So this hubris and arrogance of only arguing that ""13 Cups"" ""Best in History"" ""UCL hymn sounds and we transform"" etc. is just a ridiculous narrative that fanatic Madristas used as propaganda to cover their shit by throwing out more of it. No justification, sportingly speaking, for Madrid to have won the past 2 UCL's as take Ronaldo out, and the team play exactly the same. It is more complex than this but the short stick is RM need to take a good look in the miror, humbly introspect on this past 5 years and really objectively value this past 5 years as a WHOLE. Not just rely on the damn Champions League because this is what has made them mediocre in the first place. Complacency and arrogance.

&#x200B;

> A few signings will bring them back on track 

See this would have been true before this debacle when Florentino even got to get 8 players from THIS team to be nominated for the Ballon D'or. PLUS Modric the ""Best Player of 2018"". SO, teams know that RM NEEDS to sign, as soon as they knock, they will triple their asking prices. Also this so called Ballon D'or nominees, have been loosing value exponentially. So again, not as simple as, their usual out of splashing cash at  ""smaller"" teams who fear the great big bad RM and fall prey to their whims. Again, this era of terror and dictatorship has ended. Teams WANT to be that RM of old, so they don't want to just hand them over their effectives as teams now have the money and backing to compete against them. So, don't be surprised if they get 1 galactico at best. OJITO

He was amazing for Atletico, great for Chelsea - maybe with a minor dip towards the end - and crucial for the Belgian NT. He even got the goalkeeper of the tournament awarad last WC.

It's not like he forgot how to be a goalkeeper. It's just that at a high level, you can't give chances like RM is giving. They will be punished. You can maybe hope that your GK gets one or two crazy saves in, which Courtois did. It's just not a feasible strategy to rely on your keeper to keep your nets clean when you allow your opponent uncontested shots.

The defense and majority of the midfield are just in shambles. Also, all those stars saying that it's their time to shine now that Ronaldo is gone. Where are they? Benzema and Kroos were horrible. The only one showing some redeemable properties today was Vinicious, Modric and if I'm being generous, Bale.

Navas was always decent, but what made Madrid win their CL's was their extremely tight defense and midfield combined with the capacity to score at any given moment. It's not like Navas was notably crucial in most of your CL wins.",1551824989.0,5,:Royal_Antwerp:,Soccer,3,N

I completely agree that Real Madrid their defense and midfield are in shambles this season, the only players who are playing well are Modric, who has the rough task of covering for both Kroos and Casemiro their slacking, and Reguilon who is doing great for his first season at this level of play.

"> 2 players don't make a team. Last time, you used the word defenders. Now, it's down to Ramos. HAHAHAHAHAGA.

They clearly do though. Every successful team has a couple of key players. 

Without Messi, Barca are a pretty ordinary side (compared to the top level of football). Without Xavi and Iniesta Spain would still be trophyless. 

Ramos is one of the best defenders ever, obviously not having him makes a difference.

> If you actually watched the league, you'd have seen this coming from a mile.

Seen what coming? Even people that hate Madrid didn't think they'd play like a Sunday league team when 0-0 or 1-0 would send them through. 

Barca are amazing in the league every year and have been poor in Europe for three years, that's why people don't care about domestic form.

"> Shouldn't being a part of the EU help their economy in some way? 

It does, before they joined the EU they were much poorer. However:

- they still tend to have big boom & bust cycles, where speculative bubbles crash suddenly (cycles are inevitable, but they should be smoothed as much as possible).
- like in some other Euro countries, one of the early effects of the common currency (making borrowing money cheaper than before, because the currency was now effectively backed by Germany and France) was somewhat exploited, so their public debt ballooned and it's now around 100% of GDP. For reference, Italy is around 130%, Greece 180%, UK 85%, Germany 65%, France 97%.
- high public debt to service makes it difficult for government to have money to invest in development and public services, keeping unemployment high.
- Spain is a big country, a lot of it has always been poor and unattractive from an economic point of view.

This said, the EU helped.

- Spanish businesses tend to be cheaper than Italian/French/German counterparts, so in the level-playing field of the common market they are quite competitive (particularly so before the expansion to Eastern Europe).
- Spain developed early strategies to put European infrastructure & development funds to good use, including a first-class presence in Bruxelles. They are also heavy users of exchange programs, there are Spanish students flocking to the best universities all over Europe.
- as stated above, the Euro allows Spanish government and businesses to get credit at much cheaper interest rates than they would ever get with the peseta.",1551830821.0,40,:Italy:,Soccer,3,N

Since the top tax bracket (45%) for wages starts at €150k euros *per year*, we'll assume the average paid is close enough to 45% as well. This puts his wage cost to the club at over €38m per year, before bonuses.

Yes, your team spends more on wages on one player than the entirety of Ajax associated players cost in wages. No, singling out Barcelona is not relevant here because they aren't the metaphorical shark that just got taken out by a (relative) minnow. Real were the reigning champions, for three years running, who had attended the last 5 finals, and were decimated at home by a team who hadn't seen the round of 16 in *over a decade* (2005-06).

Being an egotistical bully towards opposition doesn't stop you from being a leader. Ramos is a warrior and even though he is a scumbag, he is an incredible presence (not least physically) on the field and in particular in the defense. People dislike him because he isn't a good guy and that's fair, but to say he isn't a good leader is bs, because now we've twice seen them in the CL (almost) throw it all away when Ramos isn't there to control things and bring the fire.

im not emotional about mourinho. i think hes a cunt but that doesnt stop me from being objective. he set up a talented team w good defence and a great counter and gave them a consistently workable gameplan, but he divided that locker room, divided the fan base, and aliented players.

ramos is just a cunt to the opposition, he saves his bullying for people he haspower over and is supposed to lead like reguilon. ramos isnt a warrior, hes aggressive and talented, theres a difference.

warriors dont cheat and look for shortcuts and ways out. egotists by virtue of being able to move people around can look like leaders and galvanize people but their ego is based on them feeling good not on them winning or winning the right way. they fail you in the end

"He was Pep Guardiola's assistant manager, right-hand man, and very good friend during his time as Barca manager. When Tito took over, Pep said that Tito was responsible for half the genius of the tactical success of Barca during Pep's tenure there. In the first half of Tito's only season as coach, when he was healthier, we won 18 games and drew only 1 (2-2 against Madrid in the Bernabeu, iirc). 

He was a magnificent coach.",1551842400.0,27,:FC_Barcelona:,Soccer,3,N
"Barca equaled the La Liga points record in his sole year in charge (set just the previous year by Mourinho's Real Madrid), but obviously the huge loss in Champions League put a damper on the season. He did a good job of continuing Pep's legacy at Barca, but had to retire after one season for cancer treatment.",1551835224.0,27,:FC_Barcelona:,Soccer,3,N
">what you said mourinho did for the team in your first comment, history and evidence straight from the players says he didnt do, and in fact did the opposite but you've ignored that in your new comment bc you dont have a defense against it.

One thing is what people say about how it ended, another thing is the objective facts such as results and attitude.

>im not emotional about mourinho. i think hes a cunt but that doesnt stop me from being objective. he set up a talented team w good defence and a great counter and gave them a consistently workable gameplan, but he divided that locker room, divided the fan base, and aliented players.

Yes he did, and he ruined his legacy there. But until then his legacy was great, and he broke records and made that team great after many years of being subpar in Europe specifically and beat Pep's Barca in the league.

>warriors dont cheat and look for shortcuts and ways out. egotists by virtue of being able to move people around can look like leaders and galvanize people but their ego is based on them feeling good not on them winning or winning the right way. they fail you in the end

That's just wrong. Suarez is a warrior. A piece of shit like ramos, but still a warrior. Ronaldo is also a warrior, hes not an asshole but even if he was, he'd still be a warrior. Playing nice is not the difference between an egoist and a warrior

>notice great leader ramos has been there before and after ronaldo but the simple removal of cristiano has left them looking lost, tired, and old just like they were looking uninspired before him

You're right Ramos has been there before, but like dude what is your point? That was 10 years ago, he had played 100 games and was 22 years old. It's not really a shock he wasn't the leader he is today.

They were just as lost and much further behind in the league last season even with Ronaldo, I struggle to see your argument. ",1551887169.0,1,:Denmark:,Soccer,3,N

"You’re just being a muppet.

As for the league cup final, Kepa saved a PK and it’s not his fault Jorginho and Luiz couldn’t finish their PKs. ",1551824781.0,-1,:Chelsea:,Soccer,3,N

And when you say “he gave up”, he didn’t give up, he stayed on the field through injury as Nacho got red carded anyways. If he left the pitch there, Real would only have 9 players in the pitch.
