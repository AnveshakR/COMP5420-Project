"There's Fixed amount rewards and then there are market pool rewards. What we're taking about here is market pools.

You're​ right league placing affects the market pool but only 50% of the market pool is allocated that way.

As champions Leicester will have received 40% of that 50% of the market pool.

The other 50% is allocated as follows 'the amount representing the value of each market will be paid in proportion to the number of matches played by each club in the 2016/17 UEFA Champions League.

Each time that a club from an association represented by one or more clubs in the UEFA Champions League group stage is eliminated in the play-offs, 10% of that association's market pool share will be deducted and allocated to the eliminated club. This is a new arrangement which was not part of the distribution system prior to the 2015–18 commercial cycle.'

"I think whenever you talk about a promising winger you have to imagine that player without any pace. What qualities does he have that justify a place in a top team, disregarding his pace? Bale's shooting and crossing is immense. From wide positions some of the best crossing in the game right now. Immense pace and spin. And just look at his free-kicks. He clearly knows how to hit a football. Reus is exactly the same. Passing, shooting he could do very well as a CAM. Bernardo Silva, his technique is amazing. Ball always close to his body, great vision. What does Sterling have? Obviously he knows how to finish once it's a 1 on 1. But other than that? Everything he does is with his pace. That's nice when you are playing on the counter, but fairly useless otherwise. I suppose you could use that hypothetical ""no-pace"" situation for any player.
