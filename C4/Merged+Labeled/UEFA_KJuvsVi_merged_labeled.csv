Unlucky for Juve to not score. Has to be said, when Villareal were the ones setting the tempo, they were moving so well between the lines and consistently finding the free man. Villareal in the first half, always in the match always.

  
Second half, Emery mixed it up. Gave Juve the ball and let Juve set the tempo. Juve, next to never was finding the free man between the lines. Looked like Juve in that second half could have played another 90 minutes without conceding and they would never score. Villareal always looked more in their toes when attacking in the second half, more bright because they were covering the ground very well while defending, saving their energies. The pen comes with those between the lines movements and the right changes at the right time.Tactically wise, fully deserved from Villareal, they didn't take anything they didn't deserve from today's match.

Obviously the users of r/soccer that didn't watch the game will be busy mocking and spewing bullshit and that's fine, we deserve that after this result, but we were the better team and it's very unfortunate for it to have gone this way. I have probably hated around 90% of the games played this season, even when we won we were absolute shit. Today though, while we weren't anything crazy compared to actual strong teams, for sure, we tried to play actual football for once and we would've deserved the win. Though I guess karma took us out, fair play to Villarreal for having won against us like we've won countless times this season against others. Can't even be mad at that point. Just sad.

Exactly! If we get CL I can't see us making Top 4 with Arteta again while competing in there. I rate a lot of PL managers above him too.
