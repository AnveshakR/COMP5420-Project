"Regarding the VAR decision.  Contrary to what the announcers said there being green between the ball and the line does not necessarily make it out of bounds.  The ball has to be completely over the line meaning that if you drew a line straight up into the air from the line if any part of that line was touching any part of the ball it is still in.  So the very bottom of the ball might be touching past the line but another point on the ball not touching the ground still could be over the line making it still in.

I couldn't tell if it was still in or not but the announcers don't help the situation by mis-explaining the rules and spreading ignorance by claiming that if there is green between the line and the part of the ball touching the ground it must be out as this is not what the laws of the game say.",1551821670.0,73,:Chelsea:

"Besides the fact that Ajax played a fantastic game;

1. Vinicius's injury. The kid is in a great form.
2. Benzema slipping and fucking up a wonderful opportunity.
3. Ajax getting a favorable call even after reviewing the play.
4. Ramos being an arrogant ass and claiming that he intentionally forced a yellow in one of the previous games and getting an extra game ban (eventually missing this game).
5. Bale's current garbage attitude.

All the above added up to get Real knocked out of CL.

I wouldn't call this the end of an era. Real are still a solid team. They just lost one fantastic player. They're still the team they were. If Real get a good manager next season, they'll bounce back to becoming a better team again.",1551827984.0,41,:FC_Barcelona:

Worst thing is we keep getting away with it and we don't learn so as much as I want them to win, this finally might be a wake up call for the team.

It's our game to lose,1551818938.0,3,:Ajax:
I know Ajax players are excited about this opportunity to kill the game but I think they should control the play and keep hold of the possession. They're lucky Real haven't been clinical.,1551818952.0,3,:FC_Barcelona:

"The grit of these Ajax players in every duel, magnificent. 

A little bit of luck was needed in Bale's chance but sometimes fortune favours the bold. 

Real doesn't really show anything similar to being  cohesive unit in the back and most of the chances came from either individual moves or from the wings, not much to see through the middle.

Madrid's defense makes it way too easy for Ziyech and Co. to ping through balls into unbelievably big spaces between their defenders.
