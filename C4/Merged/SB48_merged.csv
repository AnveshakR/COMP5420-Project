"Thanks Seattle Seahawks for saving the NFL.  Here's all the good things that will happen if other teams start to imitate the winners:

1) Front office should be football people.  Often these people have some ties to being developed in Green Bay's organization, such as for Seattle John Schneider and Scot McCloughan.

2)  Owners should probably not meddle in selecting personnel.  Owners should concentrate on researching who the best football people are and hiring them.  They can also make special arrangements for special people such as Scot McCloughan who apparently legitimately demanded flexibility in the job to be able to spend more time with his family, in particular, his children.

3)  There can be some flexibility, regardless of who has the official final say in personnel, between who gets the credit between front office and head coach for building teams.  There's not enough time in the day for almost all head coaches to also act as GM.

4) Bigger is better for almost all positions on the field except for quarterback.  This will open up spots for athletes to be moved from positions where they are mediocre to positions to where they can dominate, such as with Richard Sherman.

5) It's great that a shorter more mobile quarterback can play well in the Super Bowl.  Perhaps this will encourage more of them to take a shot at graduating and going to a team like Wisconsin that runs power from the I-formation so they can get more acclimated to an offense more resembling what is in the NFL.  It's also great that a team can win a Super Bowl not necessarily having to successfully woo an all-time great quarterback.  That doesn't scale to 32 teams.

6) It's fantastic a team can still win a Super Bowl in a dominant fashion with defense and a power running game.  That's a model that can be imitated by many more teams in the NFL than trying to find that one magic all-time HOF quarterback with a first round draft pick.",1391397155.0,228,:NFL: NFL,Football,3

However, the Broncos are a great team. More importantly, Peyton Manning is still one of the best QBs to ever play. This is certainly a very dark spot on his career. However if you look at the tape, admittedly he didn't have a great game, but the blame really belongs on the O-line. They let our guys get to Manning far to easily. 

To Broncos fans, thanks for the congratulations. Believe me, we know what it feels like.

"In the NFL Power Rankings this year I ranked the Broncos between #2 and #5 the entire year. I had the Seahawks #1 for almost the entire season.

Each week I would explain myself and give my reasons. Each week I basically gave reasons that forecasted tonight's game and predicted it. And each week I got -50 downvotes every time I said something that has been proved right.

I was silent after the Broncos fell to the Patriots. I'm not silent now. All of you Broncos fans (and /u/spy_spy) who gave me relentless downvotes, mockery and bullshit? Told me I didn't know what I was talking about, that I was stupid or didn't understand football? Where are you now?

Normally I'm not one to rub salt in anyone's wounds, but a bunch of you deserve to hear me now. I took all of your shit and was polite and well-reasoned when you were not. I answered so many people personally and gave a fuck. What's up?

To the Seahawks fans - I may not love you guys, but I have stood behind you and sang your praises since Pete got there. Even when you didn't believe, I did. Objectively you are the best. Try to be better about it than the Broncos fans were to me.",1391396147.0,2698,:Steelers: Steelers,Football,3

"I know this will come off as bragging.. but I'm still just shocked that the Seahawks didn't have a single weak link today really.

I mean seriously. Even guys I've been giving a hard time this year like Chris Clemons showed up big time today.

Everyone was just clicking on all cylinders. And the offense looked totally different (awesome as fuck) with Percy Harvin playing a full game. It just seems hard to account for RW's mobility, Lynch in the tackles, and Harvin on a fly sweep or screen every single play, on top of the other players like Tate/Baldwin/Kearse.

I'm convinced that Russell Wilson could have dropped 400 yards on the Broncos if he needed to. He played with a confidence (step back, step into throw, throw a bullet) that people have been wondering where it went. (I credit that to elite defenses like the 49ers making him uncomfortable and not wanting to turn the ball over)

He was throwing lasers all day though.",1391411881.0,9,:Seahawks: Seahawks,Football,3

"What colleges want from their quarterbacks:  take almost all snaps from the shotgun, run the zone read option, let the coaches call the plays from the sidelines and the adjustments and maybe almost never huddle, don't throw the football unless a receiver is wide open and either wait for the receiver to get open or take off running the football, go for the big play.

What the pros want from quarterbacks: take a lot of snaps under center handing the ball off to the running back, read the defense and make adjustments, go through a progression and throw a short accurate pass to a spot to convert on third and medium.

Something has to give.  There simply are not enough places like Wisconsin for someone like Russell Wilson to develop the skills needed for functioning in the NFL in the two year or even one year window teams seem to be demanding nowadays.  With the lack of any sort of structured development league now that NFL Europe ceased to play, I have no idea where these quarterbacks coming out of most college programs are supposed to acquire the skills they will need in the pros.",1391410969.0,8,:NFL: NFL,Football,3

"A bit late to the game, but thought I'd share my thoughts on this before going to bed.

These are obviously two really talented teams. But man, Seattle is something else. They showed maybe the most well-rounded expose of football I think I've ever seen. 

Percy Harvin - whoa. I knew he was fast, but that first end-around play dropped my jaw when he turned on that jetpack. 

Jermaine Kearse - future star right here. The Seattle wideout corps is lookin better and better.

Cam Chancellor = Boss. 

What this win comes down to I think, along with a talented depth chart, a little bit of luck in the beginning to have momentum swing in your favor, is Pete muthafuckin Carrol. Just watching him after games, this guy obviously keeps great relationships with his players. And obviously whatever he is doing is working. The entire team is extremely well disciplined.

"Woke up feeling like shit because of the game. I'm not even a Broncos fan! What I think did it was a ""hero effect"". The media makes Manning into basically Superman on the football field. You watch the game and you expect at any moment that Superman is going to come in and save the day. When he doesn't, it makes you feel like shit because the hero lost at the end of the movie.

That said, what a game by the Seahawks defense. It looked claustrophobic out there whenever they stepped onto the field. Manning, for what it's worth actually played fairly well all things considered, but those guys played on another level. 

It seemed like even the Broncos were waiting for that one moment that Peyton Manning would ""turn on"" and suddenly score 50 points, but it never came. I think that as much as he benefited the team, he was also their downfall. Whenever they played poorly, they had good ole Manning to fall back on. It always seemed to me that the positive feedback loop created by these kinds of circumstances would prevent players from finding that extra level of excellence required to pull out the biggest games. They weren't out there to shut out the Seahawks offense, they were out there to make enough stops for Peyton to come in and outscore the other team and win the game.",1391425588.0,5,,Football,3

"Seattle's win is great for the NFL because it opens up so many possibilities for teams to improve apart from trying to get the once-in-a-lifetime quarterback.

Players like Kam Chancellor and Richard Sherman were undervalued in the draft.  But let's not be hasty and just assert: ""Go and draft dbs who are this tall and have this arm length.""  It's interesting they played for top tier college programs, programs that regularly get invited to BCS bowl games, Virginia Tech and Stanford, and these programs are known for great defense.  Hmm, perhaps there has been an overreaction now undervaluing whether someone played in a bigtime program apart from the obvious choices such as the Alabamas and LSUs.

Kam Chancellor and Richard Sherman also in their careers have played offense, Kam Chancellor a high school quarterback and Richard Sherman a converted wide receiver.  Perhaps that gives them an edge in developing football IQ for playing their position on defense in the NFL.

Obviously there is no one answer, but a Seattle victory hopefully starts a discussion to broaden how athletes are evaluated.",1391461394.0,3,:NFL: NFL,Football,3

"Forward: I have had a few beers to numb the pain, but this should be generally accurate. Also, I am a lifelong fan, born in Denver and have followed the Broncos passionately every year since.

Who knows what happened on the safety, but ultimately it was Peyton's fault. He is the 'offensive general', nothing escapes him (supposedly). But still, they never recovered from this miss-step. I want to say they would have made it with Cutler and this team, or Cutler and Marshall and this team. I hate to say it but Bowlen messed it up with his Alzheimer's, and trading away the franchise. With Elway and Cutler and Marshall they would have won this. Peyton just is not a clutch player. He seems better than he is because of the rule changes to make the league more exciting for casual fans (bias against pass defense=higher scoring games). That is why Brady and others have beat him so many times in the post season,  Peyton is just the ultimate unclutch QB.  He is only good when things go his way. All prep and no emotion. I hope he retires this year. If he blames his O line that is absolute bullshit. Elway would have won this game, as would have many others. Peyton has his great supporting cast, he just couldn't do it, and that is a shame.",1391398480.0,8,:Broncos: Broncos,Football,3

"I have to wonder if the example of guys such as Taylor Mays at Southern Cal helped shape what Pete Carroll wanted in the pros at Seattle.  In ""explosiveness"" measurements such as vertical + broad jump + bench press reps Taylor Mays is off the charts, well above the 70 someone like Pat Kirwan would say marks a great athlete.  But is that what is most important for a safety?  Taylor Mays has enough raw physical talent to where he has and will play for years in the NFL, but it seems to me he has never had the football IQ to be a great safety.  Also apparently he was sometimes being played as a free safety at USC before he asked to be moved to where he could play more in the box.

Whereas at Seattle, the Seahawks with a first round draft pick got a smaller fantastic play maker Earl Thomas and then with a fifth round pick drafted Kam Chancellor.  It seems Kam Chancellor's physical skills are well above what is needed to be excellent in the modern NFL.  And both safeties football IQs are fantastic.",1391404331.0,4,:NFL: NFL,Football,3

While I wasn't really rooting for either team, I would have liked to have seen the Broncos come out on top, as I know a few people from Colorado.  That being said, I just find the outcome of tonight's game to be a bit comical. 

This has to have been the least entertaining Super Bowl I can ever remember watching.  It didn't even resemble a contest.  When you know the outcome of the game by the middle of the second quarter, it's not exactly exciting to keep watching. 

As far as the commercials go, I was even more disappointed than by the gameplay.  Usually I look forward to them, as it's the one time per year that commercials are entertaining, but that really wasn't the case.  The doritos commercial with the time machine was just stupid, and the one about the Doberman Chihuahua mix was just annoying to sit through.  I don't even remember what the last one was advertising come to think of it.  

Lackluster play and poor quality commercials gave me a sour taste for this one.  I didn't bother to watch the halftime show, as I had to catch up on some schoolwork, but I just wanted to give you all the perspective from a non-football fan.   ",1391405675.0,4,,Football,3

Harvin deserved the MVP. Runback for a TD at the start of the 2nd half? That was the play of the game. Football is a game of momentum and when you're dominated the first half and the very first play of the second half you have someone run back for a touchdown?

I get that people wanted to recognize the defense, but to me, the guy that really killed them was Harvin, who also rushed for two giant carries as well.

EDIT: Too many people to reply to... I'll just say good points all around. It's all subjective anyway. Honestly I just wish it was a much better game.

But when you're presented a game where a team nearly shuts out the other (and on the super bowl game?) it makes you think how did this happen? The Super Bowl is a game when the 2 best teams play a game to determine the best team of the season, but this game made me ask how did the broncos get to the Super Bowl? It's a game where you wanna see it to the end, but this game nearly made me stop watching and call it a day. Now don't get me wrong, there were some really amazing plays by the Seahawks and I applaud them on their win but it just seemed like a shame to see the broncos go out like that.

Not because the greatest QB of all time won't get another ring.

Not because the hated division rival Seahawks will be getting a ring.

But because if Kaepernick could throw a better fade route, the 49ers would've whupped the shit out of the Broncos on the way to #6. The 49ers put up a bigger fight against the Seahawks than the Broncos did. The Broncos O-line couldn't block, the D-line couldn't get pressure on Wilson, the defense can't tackle, the special teams can't cover a kickoff. 

2 years in a row, the season ends on a fade route to Crabtree. Damn homie, you gotta work fades to Crabtree all offseason long, corner of the endzone fades, toe tap fades, back shoulder fades, fade stops, just practice your fades a kajillion times.

You earned it this year, Seahawks, enjoy it while it lasts cuz you're gonna have to pay these studs and you won't be able to keep all of them.
