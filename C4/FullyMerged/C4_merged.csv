"Thanks Seattle Seahawks for saving the NFL.  Here's all the good things that will happen if other teams start to imitate the winners:

1) Front office should be football people.  Often these people have some ties to being developed in Green Bay's organization, such as for Seattle John Schneider and Scot McCloughan.

2)  Owners should probably not meddle in selecting personnel.  Owners should concentrate on researching who the best football people are and hiring them.  They can also make special arrangements for special people such as Scot McCloughan who apparently legitimately demanded flexibility in the job to be able to spend more time with his family, in particular, his children.

3)  There can be some flexibility, regardless of who has the official final say in personnel, between who gets the credit between front office and head coach for building teams.  There's not enough time in the day for almost all head coaches to also act as GM.

4) Bigger is better for almost all positions on the field except for quarterback.  This will open up spots for athletes to be moved from positions where they are mediocre to positions to where they can dominate, such as with Richard Sherman.

5) It's great that a shorter more mobile quarterback can play well in the Super Bowl.  Perhaps this will encourage more of them to take a shot at graduating and going to a team like Wisconsin that runs power from the I-formation so they can get more acclimated to an offense more resembling what is in the NFL.  It's also great that a team can win a Super Bowl not necessarily having to successfully woo an all-time great quarterback.  That doesn't scale to 32 teams.

6) It's fantastic a team can still win a Super Bowl in a dominant fashion with defense and a power running game.  That's a model that can be imitated by many more teams in the NFL than trying to find that one magic all-time HOF quarterback with a first round draft pick.",1391397155.0,228,:NFL: NFL,Football,3,N

However, the Broncos are a great team. More importantly, Peyton Manning is still one of the best QBs to ever play. This is certainly a very dark spot on his career. However if you look at the tape, admittedly he didn't have a great game, but the blame really belongs on the O-line. They let our guys get to Manning far to easily.

I was silent after the Broncos fell to the Patriots. I'm not silent now. All of you Broncos fans (and /u/spy_spy) who gave me relentless downvotes, mockery and bullshit? Told me I didn't know what I was talking about, that I was stupid or didn't understand football? Where are you now?

"I know this will come off as bragging.. but I'm still just shocked that the Seahawks didn't have a single weak link today really.

I mean seriously. Even guys I've been giving a hard time this year like Chris Clemons showed up big time today.

Everyone was just clicking on all cylinders. And the offense looked totally different (awesome as fuck) with Percy Harvin playing a full game. It just seems hard to account for RW's mobility, Lynch in the tackles, and Harvin on a fly sweep or screen every single play, on top of the other players like Tate/Baldwin/Kearse.

I'm convinced that Russell Wilson could have dropped 400 yards on the Broncos if he needed to. He played with a confidence (step back, step into throw, throw a bullet) that people have been wondering where it went. (I credit that to elite defenses like the 49ers making him uncomfortable and not wanting to turn the ball over)

He was throwing lasers all day though.",1391411881.0,9,:Seahawks: Seahawks,Football,3,4U

"What colleges want from their quarterbacks:  take almost all snaps from the shotgun, run the zone read option, let the coaches call the plays from the sidelines and the adjustments and maybe almost never huddle, don't throw the football unless a receiver is wide open and either wait for the receiver to get open or take off running the football, go for the big play.

What the pros want from quarterbacks: take a lot of snaps under center handing the ball off to the running back, read the defense and make adjustments, go through a progression and throw a short accurate pass to a spot to convert on third and medium.

Something has to give.  There simply are not enough places like Wisconsin for someone like Russell Wilson to develop the skills needed for functioning in the NFL in the two year or even one year window teams seem to be demanding nowadays.  With the lack of any sort of structured development league now that NFL Europe ceased to play, I have no idea where these quarterbacks coming out of most college programs are supposed to acquire the skills they will need in the pros.",1391410969.0,8,:NFL: NFL,Football,3,N

"A bit late to the game, but thought I'd share my thoughts on this before going to bed.

These are obviously two really talented teams. But man, Seattle is something else. They showed maybe the most well-rounded expose of football I think I've ever seen. 

Percy Harvin - whoa. I knew he was fast, but that first end-around play dropped my jaw when he turned on that jetpack. 

Jermaine Kearse - future star right here. The Seattle wideout corps is lookin better and better.

Cam Chancellor = Boss. 

What this win comes down to I think, along with a talented depth chart, a little bit of luck in the beginning to have momentum swing in your favor, is Pete muthafuckin Carrol. Just watching him after games, this guy obviously keeps great relationships with his players. And obviously whatever he is doing is working. The entire team is extremely well disciplined.

"Woke up feeling like shit because of the game. I'm not even a Broncos fan! What I think did it was a ""hero effect"". The media makes Manning into basically Superman on the football field. You watch the game and you expect at any moment that Superman is going to come in and save the day. When he doesn't, it makes you feel like shit because the hero lost at the end of the movie.

That said, what a game by the Seahawks defense. It looked claustrophobic out there whenever they stepped onto the field. Manning, for what it's worth actually played fairly well all things considered, but those guys played on another level. 

It seemed like even the Broncos were waiting for that one moment that Peyton Manning would ""turn on"" and suddenly score 50 points, but it never came. I think that as much as he benefited the team, he was also their downfall. Whenever they played poorly, they had good ole Manning to fall back on. It always seemed to me that the positive feedback loop created by these kinds of circumstances would prevent players from finding that extra level of excellence required to pull out the biggest games. They weren't out there to shut out the Seahawks offense, they were out there to make enough stops for Peyton to come in and outscore the other team and win the game.",1391425588.0,5,,Football,3,N

"Seattle's win is great for the NFL because it opens up so many possibilities for teams to improve apart from trying to get the once-in-a-lifetime quarterback.

Players like Kam Chancellor and Richard Sherman were undervalued in the draft.  But let's not be hasty and just assert: ""Go and draft dbs who are this tall and have this arm length.""  It's interesting they played for top tier college programs, programs that regularly get invited to BCS bowl games, Virginia Tech and Stanford, and these programs are known for great defense.  Hmm, perhaps there has been an overreaction now undervaluing whether someone played in a bigtime program apart from the obvious choices such as the Alabamas and LSUs.

Kam Chancellor and Richard Sherman also in their careers have played offense, Kam Chancellor a high school quarterback and Richard Sherman a converted wide receiver.  Perhaps that gives them an edge in developing football IQ for playing their position on defense in the NFL.

Obviously there is no one answer, but a Seattle victory hopefully starts a discussion to broaden how athletes are evaluated.",1391461394.0,3,:NFL: NFL,Football,3,N

"Forward: I have had a few beers to numb the pain, but this should be generally accurate. Also, I am a lifelong fan, born in Denver and have followed the Broncos passionately every year since.

Who knows what happened on the safety, but ultimately it was Peyton's fault. He is the 'offensive general', nothing escapes him (supposedly). But still, they never recovered from this miss-step. I want to say they would have made it with Cutler and this team, or Cutler and Marshall and this team. I hate to say it but Bowlen messed it up with his Alzheimer's, and trading away the franchise. With Elway and Cutler and Marshall they would have won this. Peyton just is not a clutch player. He seems better than he is because of the rule changes to make the league more exciting for casual fans (bias against pass defense=higher scoring games). That is why Brady and others have beat him so many times in the post season,  Peyton is just the ultimate unclutch QB.  He is only good when things go his way. All prep and no emotion. I hope he retires this year. If he blames his O line that is absolute bullshit. Elway would have won this game, as would have many others. Peyton has his great supporting cast, he just couldn't do it, and that is a shame.",1391398480.0,8,:Broncos: Broncos,Football,3,4F

"I have to wonder if the example of guys such as Taylor Mays at Southern Cal helped shape what Pete Carroll wanted in the pros at Seattle.  In ""explosiveness"" measurements such as vertical + broad jump + bench press reps Taylor Mays is off the charts, well above the 70 someone like Pat Kirwan would say marks a great athlete.  But is that what is most important for a safety?  Taylor Mays has enough raw physical talent to where he has and will play for years in the NFL, but it seems to me he has never had the football IQ to be a great safety.  Also apparently he was sometimes being played as a free safety at USC before he asked to be moved to where he could play more in the box.

Whereas at Seattle, the Seahawks with a first round draft pick got a smaller fantastic play maker Earl Thomas and then with a fifth round pick drafted Kam Chancellor.  It seems Kam Chancellor's physical skills are well above what is needed to be excellent in the modern NFL.  And both safeties football IQs are fantastic.",1391404331.0,4,:NFL: NFL,Football,3,N

While I wasn't really rooting for either team, I would have liked to have seen the Broncos come out on top, as I know a few people from Colorado.  That being said, I just find the outcome of tonight's game to be a bit comical. 

This has to have been the least entertaining Super Bowl I can ever remember watching.  It didn't even resemble a contest.  When you know the outcome of the game by the middle of the second quarter, it's not exactly exciting to keep watching. 

As far as the commercials go, I was even more disappointed than by the gameplay.  Usually I look forward to them, as it's the one time per year that commercials are entertaining, but that really wasn't the case.  The doritos commercial with the time machine was just stupid, and the one about the Doberman Chihuahua mix was just annoying to sit through.  I don't even remember what the last one was advertising come to think of it.  

Lackluster play and poor quality commercials gave me a sour taste for this one.  I didn't bother to watch the halftime show, as I had to catch up on some schoolwork, but I just wanted to give you all the perspective from a non-football fan.   ",1391405675.0,4,,Football,3,N

Not because the greatest QB of all time won't get another ring.

Not because the hated division rival Seahawks will be getting a ring.

But because if Kaepernick could throw a better fade route, the 49ers would've whupped the shit out of the Broncos on the way to #6. The 49ers put up a bigger fight against the Seahawks than the Broncos did. The Broncos O-line couldn't block, the D-line couldn't get pressure on Wilson, the defense can't tackle, the special teams can't cover a kickoff. 

2 years in a row, the season ends on a fade route to Crabtree. Damn homie, you gotta work fades to Crabtree all offseason long, corner of the endzone fades, toe tap fades, back shoulder fades, fade stops, just practice your fades a kajillion times.

You earned it this year, Seahawks, enjoy it while it lasts cuz you're gonna have to pay these studs and you won't be able to keep all of them.

I'm going with the Chiefs. If the Chiefs didn't have Mahomes, I'd probably pick the Bucs but how can anyone pick against Mahomes? He's been a starter for three years and if some idiot on his team wasn't offsides, he would've been in the Super Bowl and probably won it his first year, he won the Super Bowl his second year and in his third year he only lost one game so far. So he's basically been unbeatable so far in his career. So if something out of his control like an injury, COVID or someone on his team screwing up doesn't get in this way, I'm not sure that he can be stopped.",1612229886.0,21,:Vikings: Vikings,Football,3,N

"Okay, I stayed up until 03:20 for your Super Bowl game, here’s what I learned. 
American football is quite fun to watch (this game had a lot more pace compared to previous years).

Some guy on the losing team beat his wife and got bullied and that’s funny to me.

The game stops with 20 seconds left on the clock for some reason.

Tom Brady pretends he’s Derek Zoolander whenever he isn’t on the pitch.

Americans love adverts and would rather watch an advert than see a streaker.

There’s just as much salt in American football as there is in Rugby.

The Match thread was actually funny, fair play guys.

Covid doesn’t exist in America?

"Tom Brady is the best quarterback of all time. Period. End of story.

Any super bowl he wins after this just continues to emphasize the fact that the dude is the goat. Period.

There is no argument, there is no but but but.. it just is.

Realize this. I cannot wait for his induction speech into the Hall Of Fame where he belongs. They've been dusting and moving shit around in canton for years now, maybe decades, to make room for his statue. its probably going to be a huge ass bust of his cock with 7 or more super bowl rings on it.

Dude is just the man. Gets it done. people give up vast amounts of cash etc just to have the chance to play for him.

LFG is his motto and he continues to get it fucking done. Hate the patriots, hate the bucs, hate tom or bill.. but one thing is for sure. Tom Brady just wins and is the best quarterback ever to play the game, and ever that we have all seen.

I doubt his run or career or anything he has done will ever be eclipsed. It just doesn't happen.. ever. But yet, Tom got it done.

Being a cowboys fan and remembering what its like to see a team be so dominant.. Brady is on that level but even more so. Ive watched football and been a fan since i was born bascially. Ive seen the cowboys dominate football and do things no other team has.. until now. The team he plays on will always be a contender, and the guy just motivates and must be a fucking alien or something because he just finds, wills, performs, or does whatever it takes to win ever game he can, and every super bowl he shows up in.

7 out of 10 is just.. unimaginable. Many players.. more than 75% or more never even sniff the super bowl.. and this guy... the guy that should have the biggest bust in canton.. has been to TEN fucking super bowls and won 7 of them.

Incredible. The absolute Everest of the sport. We as fans will never see anything like this again as fans, in any sport.

So realize that and remember that you where here and now when brady won his 7th super bowl out of ten.

Its just that insane to think hes been to 10. Won 7. I could ride his nuts for life as will so many other sports or NFL fans.

How could you not? In amazing fashion and with the utmost respect of players far and wide, globally, locally.. hell i bet creatures from other galaxies and solar systems or whatever.. know about Tom fucking Brady.

AS much as I want to see the cowboys win.. as a fan of the NFL and a fan of football in general.. its absolutely impossible to recognize true talent, leadership, and excellence at his position when you talk about quarterbacks and love/drive/heart/ and will to win each and every game the guy plays in. Regardless of its importance or factor in the season or super bowl.

If you're not recording everything that's happened in this game and every game he has played in at this level in order to remember these moments for you, your son or daughter to relive through your eyes and your head to really realize, you're missing out.

None of us will ever see something this great in the NFL in our lifetimes. Record it, remember it, and pass it on to your grandchildren and their children.

It will not happen again. It never happened before, and after his run is done, it wont happen again unless some team hits the lottery in the fucking 6th round and that guy happens to be a kid who watched tom brady growing up. but it just doesn't happen and as much as id like to see it happen again to dak and the cowboys.. i just think it wont happen again because of how special and straight up one in a trillion chance that things had to occur and happen for this type of dominance and excellence took place in the body of one human being and every team he was on.

It just doesn't happen, and if it does, it happens once in a lifetime so everyone realize and take notes on what going down..

Tom Brady is the GOAT. its not even up for debate or argument. The line used to be 5 championships.. and this guy pressed the line out to 7 championships out of 10.

"Patriots fan checking in here (I come in peace, go easy on me).

I just want to throw all my good vibes behind Tom Brady.  I’m not salty that he left the team and I don’t feel abandoned.  The Patriots were in no position to make a real Super Bowl push this season and I’m sure when the GOAT signed in Tampa this is exactly what he had in mind for the final season (or two...three?) of his career.  

Brady has given us New Englanders two decades of greatness and, despite the fact that we can be obnoxious blowhards when it comes to sports, we understand how lucky we are.  

And for the record, I don’t know a single person up here who is cheering against Brady.  He’s got the five and a half New England states (half of Connecticut secretly wants to be New York) behind him in a big way.  

Go Bucs, go Brady, go Gronk...keep gilding that legend status!  Kansas City, Mahomes...I rooted for you last year and I’ll root for you next time, but this year is for the GOAT.",1612703180.0,2,:Patriots: Patriots,Football,3,N

"And just think next year their playing in SoFi stadium. Maybe stafford and the rams will make an appearance if they can best brady and company.

Lots of big ifs though in that statement. Brady looks as good as ever. The laser he threw to GronK for the 2nd touchdown looked like he was 23 not 43.

Dude is ballin, and always has been ballin. Anyone who bets against Brady aint got the best W/L ratio thats for sure.

I learned a long time ago on football office pools to not bet against the guy. If i picked against him on the weekly pool i usually lost so i always bet with him after a few losses. 

One things for sure, the guy gets it done. Gronk got some TD's, even antonio brown made a cameo and got a TD.

If the bucs find a way to lose this, itd be like the Falcons Pats game in reverse. I think brady is well on his way to another lombardi.. but i never count mahomes out. Dude always shows up in the 3rd and 4th quarters with him and his team's back against the wall. Hell the guy has less than 10(TEN) flippin career losses.

As a coach of the Bucs, id definitely let the team know that we might as well be tied or losing.. and to play that way. If anyone can bring a team back on the verge of getting a huge loss and getting their asses kicked.. its Patrick Mahomeboy. 

Should be a great 2nd half.

And the weekend dropping 7 million bucks for that half time show was dissapointing.

Mahomes is really really good.  But since the salary cap era there has only been 1 QB who has won more than 2 Rings.  I appreciate what Mahomes has done as much as anyone.  He is going to be a top 10 and probably top 5 QB of all time when it is said and done as long as he stays healthy.  So far he has been paid 3.7M, 4.5M and 5.3M in his first 3 seasons playing.  Once he is paid something like 40M that will take 2 star players off his team that he has had for these runs.  

Right now he has the best dynamic duo in NFL history on his team in Kelce and Hill. Kelce isn't getting any younger and Hill is right now being under paid at 18M/yr.  What happens when the price tag for Hill jumps up to 24M/yr and Kelce starts to decline?

Come 6:30 EST, I will be an enemy. I will scream, I will curse Peyton Manning's name, I will wish dreadful harm every time Denver gets a first down, and I will probably rub it in your collective faces when we score. 

But for now, I still have some decency left. And I want to be a good sport. The Broncos are my second favorite team, and if they were playing anyone but the Panthers, I'd be rooting for you. So let's watch it all play out. Manning's last ride vs Newton's first. Super Bowl 50, with the two best teams in the league going head to head. Whatever happens over the next few hours, let's just agree that it should be a good one, and let's all hope that is one for the legends decades down the line.

Peace.

As a Raider fan living in Denver, I've seen every snap of every Broncos game this season.

They had 12 close calls and they converted 11 of them. Good enough for home field.

Got to the Super Bowl and dominated an ill-prepared and ill-equipped Panthers team.

If you don't believe in sports gods, here you go. They were ONE slip up away from going to Cincy and New England in the playoffs, and never once caught the bad end of the stick. A defense can only go so far until you realize that, when you convert that many, it's just destiny.

"I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I'm happy that Peyton Manning went out (likely) on a high note, cementing his place as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, though this win was no doubt helped by the amazing Broncos defense, which was the cause that led Manning to the Super Bowl in the first place. It's like how I felt for Ray Lewis in Super Bowl XLVII.

However, I also feel like Cam Newton and the Panthers' stellar season effectively means nothing now. I mean, they *did* lose the Super Bowl, which I had hoped would give me more competition than it did. But nothing, I feel, also applies to their reputation, especially Cam Newton's. Before the season started, it seemed that Carolina was stuck in a rut, with Newton just a flashy but mediocre quarterback. With this loss, it seems as though all the games Carolina won to toss away that image of theirs has reformed, and they'll have to start over. I know that Newton will win a Super Bowl. He has both the offense *and* the defense to get there.

But the fumbles and the ineffective offenses were way more about the offensive lines getting eaten alive by dominant defensive stars. I know the Super Bowl attracts a lot of casual fans, and casual fans like offense. But it's ok to have defensive slugfests too. It's ok for offenses to get carried by their defenses at times, especially when QBs like Manning and Newton have carried their teams to wins so many times before. I thought both QBs played pretty decent considering they were up against two of the best defenses in the league.

"That Denver defense is incredible. Wade Phillips is incredible. My original prediction was 24-17 Carolina. The closer it got to game time though, the more I thought Denver would win a close one. I changed it to 23-20 Denver. No way would I have predicted a two possession victory though.

A few things:

First, what an incredible come back story for Peyton. I am so happy for him. Not only within this season, but to come back from those surgeries and have a spectacular season and then get another championship. Wow.

Second, Cam's pocket awareness is awful. It always has been, but his athleticism gets him out of it. He will improve this though, and he will be a top QB in this league for a long time. Carolina isn't going anywhere. He and Russell could very well be the next great QB rivalry.

Third, I know 4th and 24 from your own 3 is an extreme long shot. However, you can't punt there. You just can't. There's 2 minutes left and it's a 2 possession game. Punting there is sealing the victory for Denver. That means the best case scenario is you take over around your 20 yard line with 40 seconds left still down 14. Now though, you have no timeouts.",1454916085.0,4,:Chiefs: Chiefs,Football,3,N

"UPDATE: (SHOULD BE FINAL UPDATE):

So this is what my brother told me what happened in regards to the beer and food fight. Basically, he was sitting like 5 or 6 rows up from them and one person threw a beer like 3 rows ahead of him and it hit a Broncos fan. This seemed planned because the Broncos fan had nachos and beer that he immediately threw at him and then grabbed another beer and threw that. 

In what seemed like seconds later, multiple people in the section began throwing food and beer everywhere. My brother was safe from the damage, no beer made it up to his row. He took out his phone to record and he said he will send me the recording after the game. 

Security came down and started grabbing people. It started with 3 or 4 people on the aisles getting grabbed but then more security came and locked down the section. People started getting grabbed out of nowhere and people started booing (don't know if they were booing the security or the foodfighters). 

Everything calmed down after about 15 minutes, but security was incredibly tight after that and the section was a emptier, which is nice. 

All in all, the most expensive food fight could be considered a success by some, I guess. ",1454898955.0,7,,Football,2,N

Unlucky for Juve to not score. Has to be said, when Villareal were the ones setting the tempo, they were moving so well between the lines and consistently finding the free man. Villareal in the first half, always in the match always.

  
Second half, Emery mixed it up. Gave Juve the ball and let Juve set the tempo. Juve, next to never was finding the free man between the lines. Looked like Juve in that second half could have played another 90 minutes without conceding and they would never score. Villareal always looked more in their toes when attacking in the second half, more bright because they were covering the ground very well while defending, saving their energies. The pen comes with those between the lines movements and the right changes at the right time.Tactically wise, fully deserved from Villareal, they didn't take anything they didn't deserve from today's match.

Monaco were superb, but we we've been absoloutly woeful. Can't get the front 5 in the game at all, and any time we do have possession we're either forced into a mistake by good pressing or just give the ball away with an awful pass.

Silva or De Bruyne off for Toure for me, we've got enough up front to score but we need to get a foothold in midfield badly.

You're​ right league placing affects the market pool but only 50% of the market pool is allocated that way.

As champions Leicester will have received 40% of that 50% of the market pool.

The other 50% is allocated as follows 'the amount representing the value of each market will be paid in proportion to the number of matches played by each club in the 2016/17 UEFA Champions League.

Each time that a club from an association represented by one or more clubs in the UEFA Champions League group stage is eliminated in the play-offs, 10% of that association's market pool share will be deducted and allocated to the eliminated club.

"I think whenever you talk about a promising winger you have to imagine that player without any pace. What qualities does he have that justify a place in a top team, disregarding his pace? Bale's shooting and crossing is immense. From wide positions some of the best crossing in the game right now. Immense pace and spin. And just look at his free-kicks. He clearly knows how to hit a football. Reus is exactly the same. Passing, shooting he could do very well as a CAM. Bernardo Silva, his technique is amazing. Ball always close to his body, great vision. What does Sterling have? Obviously he knows how to finish once it's a 1 on 1. But other than that? Everything he does is with his pace. That's nice when you are playing on the counter, but fairly useless otherwise. I suppose you could use that hypothetical ""no-pace"" situation for any player.

I couldn't tell if it was still in or not but the announcers don't help the situation by mis-explaining the rules and spreading ignorance by claiming that if there is green between the line and the part of the ball touching the ground it must be out as this is not what the laws of the game say.",1551821670.0,73,:Chelsea:,Soccer,2,N

1. Vinicius's injury. The kid is in a great form.

3. Ajax getting a favorable call even after reviewing the play.
4. Ramos being an arrogant ass and claiming that he intentionally forced a yellow in one of the previous games and getting an extra game ban (eventually missing this game).
5. Bale's current garbage attitude.

All the above added up to get Real knocked out of CL.

I wouldn't call this the end of an era. Real are still a solid team. They just lost one fantastic player. They're still the team they were. If Real get a good manager next season, they'll bounce back to becoming a better team again.",1551827984.0,41,:FC_Barcelona:,Soccer,2,N

Worst thing is we keep getting away with it and we don't learn so as much as I want them to win, this finally might be a wake up call for the team. It feels like they lost all motivation to win anything.

Every ball from Ajax was direct and helped them transition after the pressure. 

The midfield shape from Madrid was shocking. Ajax broke quickly but you were often left with Modric as the only midfielder back to defend and he hasn’t really got the legs to cover all that ground. The commentators kept highlighting young vs old which is a fair point, but Solari has also ran this side into the ground, they’re not the strongest this season but you can’t use the same team in 2 games against Barcelona and then against a high pressing Ajax side. The injuries weren’t really surprising with 3 high intensity games in a row and then Vinicius being relied upon so much this season. Obviously Solari won’t be the permanent manager and it is a bit of a write off season but the lack of rotation really is criminal

Ajax completely overran the midfield and they didn’t really play with much width at all with Ziyech and Schone coming in to support the midfield. I think that was so clever to feel they could overrun the midfield with the games that midfield 3 played previously. Tadic was also excellent in helping with that when dropping deep to link up.",1551822839.0,145,:c_Liverpool:,Soccer,3,N

"So I’m not an Ajax supporter myself.
But I thought I should share my thoughts about this team from the perspective of a guy who just loves football.

It’s just lovely to watch this team succeed.
Not only for the action on the pitch, but also for another fact.

This is a team that has a core identity, built on its tradition of developing young talents and a great history of Dutch players.

It’s not that I hate on other teams spending huge amounts on this insane transfer market.
And we all know this Team won’t be the same next year, it’s just the Reality of modern Football.

But it would have been fun to watch this team grow into something even bigger.
Even from my perspective as a Bayern supporter it would just been so cool to see more teams building up their identity and their strengths just like this Ajax Team, instead of seeing the young top talents all at the same 4-6 teams.

Just my two cents.....

Also 
Congrats to all Ajax supporters!

No motivation
No system
Creativity in final third is non existant
Defense lacks organization
The press is inefficient and leaves us exposed

Bale looked shaken from all the media talk. With a better coach this could’ve been avoided. Solari has isolated some of our best past performers and the only positive is that he has trusted the youth. He has brought nothing tactically. This team needs someone like Simeone that will scare, motivate and organize them. 

Kroos was terrible. It may be time to replace him with someone younger and more dynamic. 

Real just forced the ball forward to Vini and the boy is just not ready for that kind of role.

Benzema looked good but really lacks flair for goal. He should’ve scored a few goals in these past few games.

Flo will probably go crazy this summer and if not, then he will become the target.

"I want to start this of by congratulating Ajax and their supporters, great game and a very deserved spot in the quarter finals.


I don’t know what to say, this performance was just disgraceful. Players who have lifted everything you can lift in football like Kroos, Casemiro, Carvajal and Varane were completely invisible. Didn’t even show the desire to win, which to me is the most painful thing about all of this. I want to thank Asensio, Reguilon and Modric for their effort, they were only ones today worthy of wearing the jersey. 


As much as I will get flamed for saying this, I hope that most of the Champions League winning team gets sold. Varane, Carvajal, Kroos, Casemiro, Benzema, Bale. None of them have the hunger necessary anymore at a club like Real Madrid. Add Courtois to this too, absolute waste of money. We should have just used Navas for this last year and then tried to go for De Gea. It is time for a new era, with a new coach. Solari looked like he fixed the situation in February, a month later and we’re knocked out of every competition in the first week of March. You could fire him so a new coach could use the remainder of the season as a build up for the next, but I’m not even sure if that will fix the situation. 


La Liga for now should be used for the development of the new squad. Bench everyone apart from Modric, Reguilon and Asensio. I want to see plenty of playing time for Vini, Llorente, Brahim Diaz, Odriozola, Ceballos, Vallejo and Valverde. In the summer Perez needs to splash cash like it’s 2009, we need hungry superstars and world class talents to recover. Hazard, Eriksen, Jovic, Koulibaly, Militao, apart from Icardi I don’t care who it is as long as they are willing to give everything for the jersey.

"I hope this is a wake-up call to everyone on this sub who feels the need to have every club legend retire with us. For every fan who refuses to move on from the core (Modric/Kroos/Bale/Navas/Benz/Marcelo) just because they won a lot for us in the past but have been either inconsistent or just plain bad the last 2 seasons. 

We are Real Madrid, players come to win, not retire. Our goal is to have the best team in the world, not hold on to players past their prime. Bad form happens in stretches of a month or so, not a season or two, and the fact of the matter is our players have declined and they just don't fit together anymore and I'm not sure what is more infuriating. The fact that we have fans who don't get this or how fucking dreadful we have been this season and last, even with our fluke CL title last season.

There is literally no evidence to suggest we have any player who is the best at their position. 
Modric is good but he's also old and can me rather inconsistent.  
Kroos is unmotivated and hasn't been consistent in 2 years.  

The midfield needs a major revamp because it just doesn't work

Bale is not only past his prime but also doesn't do shit when he plays and should be here, we should eat whatever funds we have to just to sell him. 

Nacho was Mr reliable for years but there is no discussion on how poor he has been and that we can do well to sell him and Vallejo. 

Marcelo is no longer the player he once was and his time is at an end as well
 
There are so many issues with our team simply because we got complacent and chose to not make changes that we started to value club legends retiring with us than actually winning titles and it's sickening. We had Ronaldo last season and still lost the league by 20 points and some people have the audacity to simply think we need a finisher to solve all of our problems. No, we need a new damn midfield, a new right wing, new depth in our defense, as well as a new system because our core that won all those CL titles have been dire both this season and last and quite simply just isn't good enough anymore. It doesn't work anymore and it's time for people to wake up to this ",1551823444.0,3,:Real_Madrid:,Soccer,3,4F
GG to Ajax. The better team went through. As for us I don’t see how we recover from this. I’m concerned about being in the UCL next year.

As twisted as this will sound (which is very, very twisted, but bear with me on it), maybe the worst thing that could've happened this year would've been Real Madrid, somehow and inexplicably, finding a way to win the Champions League this year. It could've led Perez into thinking that Real Madrid was still good enough and not in need of major overhaul. Don't believe me? They only finished 17 points behind Barcelona last season and downgraded their roster over the summer mercato.

No, getting pants'd by Barcelona (if not in performance than on the scoreboard anyway) twice, at home, and then getting blown off their own field at the Bernabeu against, you know, ""some Dutch team"" (surely that's how many people will perceive Ajax, however wrong they are to do so) is a very good nutshell of what the last 1.5 seasons have been like at the Bernabeu, more-or-less. Real Madrid looking second rate and performing well below expected standard.

There will be an expectation for overhaul now. They need it. Their professionalism is atrocious. The roster isn't good enough. The coaching is disastrous. They need a full-scale, high-level pressure washing of that entire club. Crashing out of three competitions in the space of seven days, with all three losses coming at home? That will do it. Surely that will do it.

Finish in the top-4 and overhaul the club. Today was a long-time coming and Real Madrid badly needed this. Up to them now to take heed and act accordingly.",1551838708.0,4,:Internazionale:,Soccer,3,N

Once they are united, Frankie de Jong and Arthur will be the best Midfield pair in the world. I hope they stay together for 8-10 years. They will be the new Iniesta and Xaxi, although I don't think they'll ever surpass them.

Do you guys think there will be a better pairing? The only two I would consider is Kroos and Modric. I know their form is off but they have been class for so long and Modric is reigning Ballon d'or.

This hurts a lot and its easy to just blame certain players or the manager but for me, this all comes down to Florentino's idiocracy. The disrespect he treated cr7 within his last year from not giving him a better contract to giving the iconic number 7 to Mariano and never trying to replace him which seemed incredibly arrogant. By choosing certin managers and neglecting to buy the players the team needs this is all on florintino not the players or the manager. It's not like solari is a incredibly profound manager that has countless trophies in his cabinet so we can easily shift the blame to him, it's his first time in this situation and his lack of experience clearly showed throughout his time here. Also most of the players don't deserve the blame either this same group apart from a couple of players has won 4 champions leagues in the past 5 years, they know what to do and how to get it done but its just time for a change we all know there would be a downfall, I just hope we can enjoy watching this squad play together the rest of the season and the rebuilding process can begin in the summer because if not then it will be just like Pre CR7 era where we kept getting knocked out every year in the round of 16.",1551824217.0,2,,Soccer,3,N

"This game just exemplified why I don't understand the Madrid fans who wanted Solari to stay.

Against a well performing side his team crumbles. He has no clear idea of how he wants the team to play. I wouldn't be surprised if his instructions when it comes to attacking football boil down to *""Score goals or something.""*.

They're dangerous over lucky crosses which is not surprising considering the amount of times they just punt the ball into the box. One of those ball's going to find one of their teammates.

When it's not a cross it's the usual flash of individual brilliance by someone like Vinicius, Bale or Benzema. When it comes to actually moving the ball around in a clever manner they're absolutely clueless.

Their is no clear style of play he employs. Neither Madrid's attack nor their defense has been dominant under him. I do however blame Florentino Perez moreso than him. Who promotes a manager struggling with the Castilla to the first team?

He gained some love from the fans by bringing the usual Simeone/Gattuso-esque quotes about Cojones and all of that crap. 

Ajax' display was fantastic today. I felt like compared to the first leg it was a slightly more conservative approach with the only difference being their lethality, which was more than enough because they were already the far superior side at home.

Their relative strength should come as no surprise as they drew both matches against Bayern in the group stage and looked like the better team in both matches.  
Madrid on the other hand look overplayed and worn out. They put a lot of energy into both matches against Barcelona and when Ajax scored early they just didn't have it in them to come back into the match.  
All great teams have an era and eventually their reign ends. It simply was Madrid's time to realize that time waits for nobody.

"Before this era began, Real lost a knockout tie to another young side in the 2012-13 season, albeit in the semi-finals, the third season on the trot. That young Dortmund side was similar to this Ajax side. Played dauntlessly, pressed high, and gave everything they had. We lost 4-1 to them away with Lewa, Reus and Gotze running us ragged. But when they came to the Bernabeu, we made sure they were scared. Won 2-0 on the night and lost 4-3 on aggregate, had plenty of chances to score the all important last goal to win. But we went out without shame. The players had given everything. For the badge, for the Bernabeu, for the pride of Real Madrid. The next season, we won the Decima. 

Today was different. You'd expect they'd learn something about young teams who were technically brilliant, tactically well set up, and driven by once in a generation talent for the said club. But no, had a lead in the first leg that simply succumbed to the press within the first few minutes. Players accepted defeat before the final whistle blew, heck, even way before that; letting Ajax prance around the Bernabeu like they owned it. No urgency, no plan. Just starting the game like they'd automatically qualify and not knowing how to react like champions usually do when the going got tough. Modric's inability to shoot probably summed up what went missing through that loss 6 years ago to now. 

No matter we win, or lose, or tie; We're all Real Madrid till we die. But at least play like you're playing for it man.

"Since the start I've said that Solari is too shit to coach us. No rotation, the players were gassed. The tactics seem pretty simple, teams close us down too easily.
The right side of our attack was non existent, it is partly the reason Carvajal and Modric have looked underwhelming. 
Casemiro loses the ball too easily under pressure I hope Llorente can dethrone him soon. Nacho was shit for the 3rd goal, gave Tadic all the space to shoot instead of closing him down. Ramos would have been all over him.
Left side looked good but Vinicius injury was unfortunate. We need more defensive stability and more attacking threat, a formation change is necessary I feel, the gap between the lines is too much for teams to exploit easily. 
Ajax ofcourse have unbelievable talent in their team and unless Papa Flo realizes that the team needs reinforces asap, I fear we will have to see few seasons of relative mediocrity from us. 
A bit unfortunate to hit the post twice, Bale was good but not clinical enough. Few players have just not been upto the level of Real Madrid while the young players on whom we counted have not shown they are good enough except Reguilon and Vinicius. Bernabeu has also disappointed with the support and the squad is simply lacking the drive.

"A complete disaster, reminded me of the feelings I got when RM lost the league race in 2014 or the CL exit in 2012 with Bayern, like being empty inside, especially the third goal.

Anyway, this is how football goes, can't always win, in fact even the best squads suffer a lot more failures than successes. In some level there was a hideous beauty on what transpired on the pitch; there is no room for nonsense in elite level football, you've got to perform, show constantly that you are better, otherwise nothing can save you. This year's RM was severely underwhelming in all levels (administration, coaching, roster) and as a result failed completely.

Congratulation to Ajax who grabbed this unique chance by the hair and triumphed putting on a great performance. I would have applauded them if I was on the stands and it's a shame they have shrunk so much as a club that they'll probably lose a bunch of key figures. Tadic especially put on a masterclass, even Messi could be jealous of that.

Not in the mood to analyse RM's performance. In the days leading up to the game I thought Casemiro's performance would be crucial, that RM's best chance was defending the first leg's result and if Ajax scored 1-2 goals and RM had to compete in which squad was more capable in scoring goals ...shit. To some degree an extraordinary number of things went wrong but anyway that's the nature of knock out games, you've got to constantly be much better than your opponents, otherwise you ain't going far. Still, the fact that Solari didn't rotate recently although it was clear that today's game was the crucial one leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.

The hope is that all these failures won't be swept under the rug and this season's mistakes will work as lessons for the future. Hopefully, plenty of faces got their last chances and the time for changes is nigh.

Hala Madrid!

So funny the amount of time the spent deciding whether or not to take away the 3rd goal.

Same tactical problems that were present in the first game and the games against Barca. Attack and midfield is split with half of them running back and the other half pressing. De Jong was getting deep to collect the ball and modric tried to press (which almost is impossible) him leaving all kinds of space behind.

This didn't seem to be too much of a problem when you were pitted against Klopp's gegenpress for example. This is on the coach. What were Madrid's ways of getting goals today? Working the ball in the flanks and creating crossing opportunity in such a slow way that Ajax have six men well positioned? There are so many other things taht I could point out.

When it comes to blaming players - okay Kroos had a bad game. He also provided the best pass of the game which Bale hit the upright from. He does his job circulating the ball but nothing happens from the flanks. What is he supposed to do when he gets the ball but doesn't see too much movement ahead of him.

"Ronaldo was the biggest star in Real Madrid's history. Insane goalscorer, exceeded only by Barca's Messi whose dribbling is off the charts.

Ronaldo joined in 2009, Madrid started winning Champions League trophies with him in 2014, largely thanks to him and the manager Ancelotti, who was then succeeded by Zidane, who won it with Madrid 3 times in a row (crazy achievement). You should know that at least one of those victories is totally unjust, because of heavy referee help, and because Ramos commits vicious fouls to get ahead, injuring key players. Ronaldo and Zidane both left after the previous season ended, some say Zidane knew Madrid was a sinking ship. 

Ramos is the main defender + captain of Madrid, he started I think in 2005. In the previous game with Ajax he intentionally went for a foul that will disqualify him from yesterday's game, because it means that he will definitely not miss the NEXT game (should Madrid qualify yesterday). That means he was sure they will qualify yesterday.

"> They still have the cups in the cabinet 

And they will have them from now on, but again, having Cups in a Cabinet DO NOT GARANTEE ANYTHING. This isn't the 50's with Franco and terror regimes and whatnot. This is not that era, it's a time where you win in the field, playing, where people don't cower in front of history, they would rather rewrite it, as Ajax did. So this hubris and arrogance of only arguing that ""13 Cups"" ""Best in History"" ""UCL hymn sounds and we transform"" etc. is just a ridiculous narrative that fanatic Madristas used as propaganda to cover their shit by throwing out more of it. No justification, sportingly speaking, for Madrid to have won the past 2 UCL's as take Ronaldo out, and the team play exactly the same. It is more complex than this but the short stick is RM need to take a good look in the miror, humbly introspect on this past 5 years and really objectively value this past 5 years as a WHOLE. Not just rely on the damn Champions League because this is what has made them mediocre in the first place. Complacency and arrogance.

&#x200B;

> A few signings will bring them back on track 

See this would have been true before this debacle when Florentino even got to get 8 players from THIS team to be nominated for the Ballon D'or. PLUS Modric the ""Best Player of 2018"". SO, teams know that RM NEEDS to sign, as soon as they knock, they will triple their asking prices. Also this so called Ballon D'or nominees, have been loosing value exponentially. So again, not as simple as, their usual out of splashing cash at  ""smaller"" teams who fear the great big bad RM and fall prey to their whims. Again, this era of terror and dictatorship has ended. Teams WANT to be that RM of old, so they don't want to just hand them over their effectives as teams now have the money and backing to compete against them. So, don't be surprised if they get 1 galactico at best. OJITO

He was amazing for Atletico, great for Chelsea - maybe with a minor dip towards the end - and crucial for the Belgian NT. He even got the goalkeeper of the tournament awarad last WC.

It's not like he forgot how to be a goalkeeper. It's just that at a high level, you can't give chances like RM is giving. They will be punished. You can maybe hope that your GK gets one or two crazy saves in, which Courtois did. It's just not a feasible strategy to rely on your keeper to keep your nets clean when you allow your opponent uncontested shots.

The defense and majority of the midfield are just in shambles. Also, all those stars saying that it's their time to shine now that Ronaldo is gone. Where are they? Benzema and Kroos were horrible. The only one showing some redeemable properties today was Vinicious, Modric and if I'm being generous, Bale.

"> Shouldn't being a part of the EU help their economy in some way? 

It does, before they joined the EU they were much poorer. However:

- they still tend to have big boom & bust cycles, where speculative bubbles crash suddenly (cycles are inevitable, but they should be smoothed as much as possible).
- like in some other Euro countries, one of the early effects of the common currency (making borrowing money cheaper than before, because the currency was now effectively backed by Germany and France) was somewhat exploited, so their public debt ballooned and it's now around 100% of GDP. For reference, Italy is around 130%, Greece 180%, UK 85%, Germany 65%, France 97%.
- high public debt to service makes it difficult for government to have money to invest in development and public services, keeping unemployment high.
- Spain is a big country, a lot of it has always been poor and unattractive from an economic point of view.

This said, the EU helped.

- Spanish businesses tend to be cheaper than Italian/French/German counterparts, so in the level-playing field of the common market they are quite competitive (particularly so before the expansion to Eastern Europe).
- Spain developed early strategies to put European infrastructure & development funds to good use, including a first-class presence in Bruxelles. They are also heavy users of exchange programs, there are Spanish students flocking to the best universities all over Europe.

Since the top tax bracket (45%) for wages starts at €150k euros *per year*, we'll assume the average paid is close enough to 45% as well. This puts his wage cost to the club at over €38m per year, before bonuses.

Yes, your team spends more on wages on one player than the entirety of Ajax associated players cost in wages. No, singling out Barcelona is not relevant here because they aren't the metaphorical shark that just got taken out by a (relative) minnow. Real were the reigning champions, for three years running, who had attended the last 5 finals, and were decimated at home by a team who hadn't seen the round of 16 in *over a decade* (2005-06).

It was. They began winning the games they ""should"" win in the cups, they beat both the points and goal scoring record in La Liga, they went deep in the CL every year as soon as Mou came. Kroos is a funny example because he wasn't there when they won in 2014. Hate Mourinho all you want, it's a fact he brought them back to the top shelf in Europe.

>ramos isnt a leader, hes an egotist w charisma. its easy to get it confused but one leads to victory and the other leads to where he feels good. you can tell bc ramos is a cheating bully. real lack ronaldos spirit

Being an egotistical bully towards opposition doesn't stop you from being a leader. Ramos is a warrior and even though he is a scumbag, he is an incredible presence (not least physically) on the field and in particular in the defense. People dislike him because he isn't a good guy and that's fair, but to say he isn't a good leader is bs, because now we've twice seen them in the CL (almost) throw it all away when Ramos isn't there to control things and bring the fire.

Because you were responding to someone implying this result is irrelevant because Ramos had won it all before. But it still matters. He went out in a dumb way.
