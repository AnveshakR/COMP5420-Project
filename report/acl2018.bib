    abstract = "Understanding emotion expressed in language has a wide range of applications, from building empathetic chatbots to detecting harmful online behavior. Advancement in this area can be improved using large-scale datasets with a fine-grained typology, adaptable to multiple downstream tasks. We introduce GoEmotions, the largest manually annotated dataset of 58k English Reddit comments, labeled for 27 emotion categories or Neutral. We demonstrate the high quality of the annotations via Principal Preserved Component Analysis. We conduct transfer learning experiments with existing emotion benchmarks to show that our dataset generalizes well to other domains and different emotion taxonomies. Our BERT-based model achieves an average F1-score of .46 across our proposed taxonomy, leaving much room for improvement.",

    abstract = "Automated personality prediction from social media is gaining increasing attention in natural language processing and social sciences communities. However, due to high labeling costs and privacy issues, the few publicly available datasets are of limited size and low topic diversity. We address this problem by introducing a large-scale dataset derived from Reddit, a source so far overlooked for personality prediction. The dataset is labeled with Myers-Briggs Type Indicators (MBTI) and comes with a rich set of features for more than 9k users. We carry out a preliminary feature analysis, revealing marked differences between the MBTI dimensions and poles. Furthermore, we use the dataset to train and evaluate benchmark personality prediction models, achieving macro F1-scores between 67{\%} and 82{\%} on the individual dimensions and 82{\%} accuracy for exact or one-off accurate type prediction. These results are encouraging and comparable with the reliability of standardized tests.",

Automatic methods to detect offensive language have largely relied on datasets with categorical labels. However, comments can vary in their degree of offensiveness. We create the first dataset of English language Reddit comments that has fine-grained, real-valued scores between -1 (maximally supportive) and 1 (maximally offensive). The dataset was annotated using Best{--}Worst Scaling, a form of comparative annotation that has been shown to alleviate known biases of using rating scales. We show that the method produces highly reliable offensiveness scores. Finally, we evaluate the ability of widely-used neural models to predict offensiveness scores on this new dataset.",

    abstract = "People globally quit their jobs at high rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet there is scant research about emotional trajectories surrounding voluntary resignations before or during that era. To explore long-term emotional language patterns before and after quitting a job, we amassed a Reddit sample of people who indicated resigning on a specific day (n = 7,436), each of whom was paired with a comparison user matched on posting history. After excluding people on the basis of low posting frequency and word count, we analyzed 150.3 million words (53.1{\%} from 5,134 target users who indicated quitting) using SALLEE, a dictionary-based syntax-aware tool, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionaries. Based on posts in the year before and after quitting, people who had quit their jobs used more sadness and anxiety language than matched comparison users. Lower rates of {``}I{''} pronouns and cognitive processing language were associated with less sadness and anxiety surrounding quitting. Emotional trajectories during and before the pandemic were parallel, though pandemic messages were more negative. The results have relevance for strategic self-distancing as a means of regulating negative emotions around major life changes.",

  abstract  = "Grief is a natural and universal response to the loss of a loved
               one. The grief experience is not a state but a process. Most
               individuals recover adequately within a year after the loss;
               however, some individuals experience an extension of the
               standard grieving process. This condition has been identified as
               complicated grief or prolonged grief disorder, and it results
               from failure to transition from acute to integrated grief.
               Symptoms of acute grief include tearfulness, sadness, and
               insomnia and typically require no treatment. Intense grief over
               the loss of a significant person may trigger the acute onset of
               myocardial infarction (MI). The impact may be higher with
               cardiovascular risk. Complicated grief has prolonged symptoms of
               painful emotions and sorrow for more than one year. Complicated
               grief has also been termed as, 'prolonged grief disorder,
               'persistent complex bereavement disorder, 'pathological grief'
               and 'traumatic grief'. Both the ICD-11 and DSM-5 have approved
               diagnoses of 'prolonged grief disorder.' All of these conditions
               depict intense, impaired, and prolonged grief. Patients show a
               preoccupation with the deceased and feel inner emptiness, no
               interest in life, and sleep poorly. There is a correlation
               between complicated grief and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It
               has been estimated that 7-10\% of those bereaved do not adapt to
               the loss and, in turn, develop complicated grief. The terms
               grief, mourning, and bereavement have slightly different
               meanings: Grief is a person's emotional response to loss.
               Mourning is an outward expression of that grief, including
               cultural and religious customs surrounding the death. It is also
               the process of adapting to life after loss. Bereavement is a
               period of grief and mourning after a loss. Anticipatory Grief is
               a response to an expected loss. It affects both the person
               diagnosed with a terminal illness as well as their families. .
               Disenfranchised grief as defined by Kenneth Doka (1989) is a
               ``grief that persons experience when they incur a loss that is
               not or cannot be openly acknowledged, publicly mourned, or
               socially supported.'' Physicians regularly encounter losses in
               the form of patient deaths. Grief in healthcare providers is
               unsanctioned and may play a role in physician burnout. To
               adequately address the crisis of physician burnout, we need to
               address the under-recognized role of grief in the physician's
               clinical experience. . Takosubo Cardiomyopathy (Broken Heart
               Syndrome): is a weakening of the left ventricle caused by severe
               emotional or physical stress such as loss of a loved one, sudden
               illness, a serious accident, or a natural disaster (e.g.,
               earthquake). It almost exclusively occurs in women and resolves
               within a month.",
